-Good morning, everyone.
I'm Natalia Rost,
and I'm Scientific Chair
of the 2022 ADRD Summit,
and this is the moment
we've been waiting for
for 3 years
to get together again,
and on behalf of our entire
program-planning team,
it is my great honor
to officially open the summit
and to introduce our first
speaker, Dr. Walter Koroshetz,
Director
of the National Institute
of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke.
Welcome.
-Oh, thank you, Natalia.
Can you hear me all right?
Very good.
Yep, well, I want to welcome
everyone who's attending
and also thank all the people
who put a lot of work
into what we're going to hear
in the next 2 days.
This was really the result
of a lot of hard thinking
and very smart people,
all dedicated to this common
goal of trying to figure out
how we can better reduce
the burden of illness
due to Alzheimer-related
dementias.
The next slide, please.
And again, special thanks to
Natalia for leading the group.
I think it was a good group,
so it wasn't as hard as
some of the other groups
I made her
lead in the past.
Next slide.
So what we're talking about
is a national priority
that Congress has spoken about
and actually funded generously
to try to make a difference
in this problem
of Alzheimer-disease-related
dementias.
We're talking about
irreversible,
right now, irreversible,
progressive brain diseases
that rob people of the ability
to interact and communicate,
and eventually many of these
are fatal diseases.
They slowly destroy
brain function,
leading to cognitive decline,
behavioral and psychiatric
disorders and inability
to even function
and activities of daily
living and requiring care.
It's a major public health issue
affecting the health
and finances,
but it's really a tragedy
for the individual
and the family particularly.
So the NAPA law in 2011
offered historic opportunity
to address
the Alzheimer's disease issue
and Alzheimer's
disease-related dementias,
and we will be talking mostly
about the Alzheimer's
disease-related dementias
as opposed to Alzheimer's
as a pure entity.
That is --
comes under the purview
of the National Institute
of Aging Summit
that we intersperse
with our summit.
But as you'll see, there is
tremendous overlap
in the Alzheimer's and
the Alzheimer-related dementias,
and so learning from one really
helps learning in the others.
Next slide.
So what we're talking about
in terms of the congressionally
defined Alzheimer's
disease-related dementias
are basically the vascular
contributions of dementia,
so as our brains age,
our blood vessels
to the brain age.
This is easily seen
under the microscope,
but also the contributions
of vascular aging
and several vascular diseases
are very apparent on MRI scans,
a very sensitive technique
to pick up these changes,
and so these are things that are
standing right in front of us,
easy to identify but tricky
so far to figure out
how to decrease the contribution
of vascular disease
and vascular risk factors
for dementia
although if one looks
at the literature
in terms of a short-term win,
all the data points to the fact
that controlling vascular health
will actually reduce
cognitive impairment as we age
and also potentially reduce
the risk of developing dementia.
Lewy body dementia is a term
that's used for conditions
where there's dementia related
to what are called
these aggregates of a protein
called synuclein
inside of neurons,
also in the neurites themselves,
the processes of the neurons.
You get these aggregates
of synuclein,
and that is also the signature
of Parkinson's disease,
and many patients
with Parkinson's develop
cognitive impairment over time
because these Lewy bodies start
to move throughout the brain,
and there's also a condition
in which the Lewy bodies
start in the thinking area
of the brain
and cause dementia first
and then Parkinson's later.
Frontal temporal dementia
is also a very common
cause of dementia,
one of the more common
causes of dementia
in people who are younger,
in their 50s or 60s,
and these, again,
are associated with atrophy
and loss of brain tissue
in particular areas
of the brain.
Depending on the area, there
are these certain symptoms,
frequently troubles
with behavior or language.
And also, of interest,
we found more recently
is there's a strong association
with some of these
frontal dementias
with amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis,
which causes progressive
and fatal paralysis
of all the muscles
in the body
due to loss of the motor neurons
that control those muscles.
And finally probably also
incredibly important
is the discussion of the fact
that when people's brains
are examined who have dementia
in this elderly space,
more frequently than not,
there's a combination
of different
pathologies in the brain,
so the cause of the dementia,
we think,
is related to a combination
of the Alzheimer problem,
the synuclein problem,
the cerebrovascular problem,
and so we see
those combinations,
and certainly we're going
to treat Alzheimer's.
We're going to have to
try to understand
how each of these contributing
pathologies are best treated.
Next slide.
And so the research is focused
right now
on trying to understand
the biological mechanisms.
Without understanding those,
we really can't
develop treatments,
but there has been a lot
of progress in this space,
in discovery of targets
that could be pursued
to develop therapies,
and also importantly
is the progress
in developing biomarkers,
so these are measurements
that one can make
in living individuals
that will predict
what kind of pathology
there is going on
in the brain.
And lastly we want to mention
that the research
that's being done,
Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias,
includes a lot of gaps
in knowledge,
but there is a lot of research
going on, very basic research
in how the brain works
and how it organizes
and how inflammatory cells
interact with the brain,
both normally and abnormally,
that all kind of come together
in trying to improve
our understanding
of Alzheimer's and
Alzheimer's-related dementias.
Next slide.
And this is just to tell you
that we, you know,
it is complicated
because there are
so many factors
that go into
the development of dementia.
It's something that occurs
usually in the,
you know,
the age of individual,
and so, so many things have
happened to the brain over time,
whether it's traumatic
brain injury
or stroke or vascular disease,
the development
of these abnormal proteins,
but we have to
piece this apart...
piece this together
and identify the pieces
that are going to be
most potentially important
as targets for therapies,
but that's kind of
the just simplistic version
of what our goal is,
is to understand the features,
understand how they fit together
and then develop treatments
that are going to be effective.
Next slide.
And there has certainly
been advances over time,
particularly in
the biomarker space,
for Alzheimer's, and also,
the Alzheimer-related dementias
is,
we think, very good now,
accurate ways
of testing spinal fluid
or even skin biopsies
to detect the synuclein
aggregates that are associated
with Parkinson's disease
and Lewy body disease.
There are certain
radioactive scans
that one can do to detect
dopamine loss in people
who have Lewy body disease,
separates them
from Alzheimer's disease,
and there's now
really interesting,
very predictive studies
looking at evidence
of Alzheimer pathology in people
with Lewy body disease
and Parkinson's disease
that contributes to their
troubles with cognition,
so we're getting now the ability
to look at living individuals
and actually get evidence for
what is going on in the brain,
and as I mentioned before,
that's the critical thing
to know in determining
what treatment is going to be
best for what patient,
and so there was tremendous
progress in this space now.
Next slide.
And right, and so,
even on the vascular side,
I said, yeah, the MRI
is incredibly sensitive
to picking up changes in
the white matter of the brain,
which is very common,
associated with hypertension
and several vascular disease,
present in probably
80 percent of people
at some degree
after the age of 80.
These are kind of things
that we can,
you know,
follow over time
and see if therapy affects
their progression over time
because you're not born
with this,
but it develops over time,
and it's easy to see
on the MRI scan.
Next slide.
And just important to mention
that we are really doubling down
in looking to the future
where there are treatments
to make sure that
those treatments
are going to be available
for everyone in our society,
and that is unfortunately
not a trivial task.
People may present differently
depending on their culture,
the racial,
ethnic background.
You don't want to miss...
If you need to treat early
in the dementia,
you don't want to miss that
because there's some inequities
in the system
in terms of picking it up
in addition
to being able to make sure
that all the treatments
are accessible to folks.
You do a lot of genetic studies
to determine,
you know,
genetic risk factors.
I'm sorry to say most of that
genetic work has been done
on Caucasians
of European descent,
and we know now that
some things like APOE are --
may act very different
in African Americans,
so we really need to think
as we move forward
so that what we discover
is relevant
to all segments
of our population.
They may not all be the same,
but we need to know
what those differences are.
So thank you.
Next slide.
And I want to just end up
by thanking our partner
in this effort,
working hand in hand with
the National Institute of Aging
for many years.
We initially started, you know,
putting out the plan
not realizing that there was
going to be funding coming,
and with the funding coming,
both NIA, NINDS
and the other partners
have really put together
what I think is a really
earth-shattering series
of research projects
over the years that really
opening the door
to therapies
for these diseases now.
So I want to thank everybody
and looking forward
to hearing
the recommendations
coming out of
the different work groups.
Thank you very much.
-Thank you.
Good morning.
Thank you, Dr. Koroshetz.
My name is Cindy Carlsson.
I'm a physician in geriatrics
of University of Wisconsin
in Madison,
Professor of Medicine there,
and also with the VA hospital
in Madison, Wisconsin,
and as Chair of the Advisory
Council on Alzheimer's Research,
Care and Services,
I'll be speaking next
just for the next few minutes
to share with you
all a little bit of perspective
based on the NAPA Council.
So the National Plan
to Address Alzheimer's Disease
has already been addressed
by Dr. Koroshetz,
and we'll hear more
from Dr. Rose, Dr. Corriveau,
but again,
the national plan really,
really bases a lot of its input
from these important
research summits,
so again, as you'll see today
and as we'll touch on briefly,
these summits really feed
into helping develop these ideas
and moving this work forward,
so the NAPA plan,
which I'll talk about,
covers clinical care,
long-term services
and support and research
and has a new goal
of risk reduction,
so we have four subcommittees
that really help alter
the national plan
and move it forward,
but these summits
are critically important
as we move forward
in these areas.
Next slide, please.
So by way of disclosure, again,
these are my views,
not NIH's views or NAPA
or ASPE,
and I do receive
funding from NIH,
the VA,
NIH/Lilly and NIH/Eisai.
Next slide.
So then the National Alzheimer's
Project Act was first enacted
just over 10 years ago in 2011
as Dr. Koroshetz mentioned,
and one thing that's
extremely important to note
for this meeting is that this...
although it's called
the Alzheimer's Act,
it's really meant to include
Alzheimer's-related dementias
as well,
so again, for brevity's sake,
it just says, "Alzheimer's,"
throughout the plan,
but it says in introduction
that this is really meant
to include all the different
forms of dementias,
and so as we speak
about NAPA,
it should be whatever the
abbreviation would be pronounced
with all
the other dementias included.
So again, this is led by the
Assistant Secretary's Offices
for Planning
and Evaluation,
and they became the lead
right after that,
and then the first
Advisory Council
was in September of 2011.
The first national plan
was developed
and released
just almost 10 years ago,
so one thing, I think, that's
important for us to step back
and think about is,
as far as perspective,
is not only to look
to the future
about what areas need
to be evaluated still,
what gaps there are in research
but also for us
to take a step back
and to think about the progress
that's been made
in the last 10 years,
so thinking about new, novel
PET-scan tools, biomarker tools
that really help us
pinpoint the disease
and help us to understand
that many of these dementias
are multiple-etiology dementias.
So again, having these factors
can really help us
find the commonalities
and the differences
between these types of dementias
among many other advances.
So in our upcoming NAPA meeting,
we'll be highlighting,
having the federal agencies
highlight
the accomplishments
over the past 10 years,
so again,
taking a step back to think,
"What have we accomplished
so far,
and how can we use
that momentum to move forward?"
Next slide.
So the National Alzheimer's
Project Act
required that the Department
of Health and Human Services
establish the following items,
so again, there's two
main products out of this
that have generated a lot
of synergy with these summits,
so for example, to create
and maintain a national plan
to overcome Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias,
to coordinate research and
services across federal agencies
and, again,
not just federal agencies.
This is a national plan,
so again,
to serve as a blueprint
for states,
counties, communities
to really align their work
together
to move things forward,
to accelerate the development
of treatments
that would hopefully prevent,
halt or reverse the disease,
the numerous disease
we'll be talking about today,
improve early diagnosis
in coordination of care
and treatment of the disease,
improve outcomes
for people from racial
and ethnic-diverse
communities
throughout our country
who are at higher risk
in some cases
for developing dementia
and then coordinating with
international bodies as well,
so we really want to make sure
that we're leading the way
globally in these efforts,
and then creating
an advisory council,
which again,
I currently serve as chair,
to review and comment
on the national plan
and its implementation.
Next slide.
So the advisory council, again,
works together
to review the national plan,
to integrate ideas from summits
just like this one
to make sure
that the plan reflects
the current scientific thinking,
clinical care,
policies that are there,
and so the public arm of the
council includes 12 members,
and so these 12 members
come from diverse
backgrounds from...
Some are patient advocates,
again,
including people
who are living with dementia
and mild cognitive impairment.
There's caregivers, providers,
state
and local representatives,
researchers
and then two voluntary health
association representatives.
So again, this input is really
important as we shape the future
of research, clinical care
and long-term support services,
and again, we want people
to continue to provide input,
and as I'll mention
at the end,
there's always room
for public comment,
and so we want the public,
whether it be a researcher,
advocate, a caregiver,
to really speak into these goals
and help shape
this national plan.
We also have colleagues
from our federal --
from the federal government,
so again,
we have colleagues
from the Department of Health
and Human Services,
Veterans Affairs,
Department of Defense,
National Science Foundation,
and you'll see within Health
and Human Services we have:
the Office of
the Assistant Secretary
for Planning
and Evaluation,
or ASPE, Indian Health Service,
NIH, of course,
National Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services, CMS,
Agency for Healthcare
Research Equality,
Administration for
Community Living,
Centers for Disease Control,
Health Services Administration
and Food
and Drug Administration.
So you, again, see that
there's this partnership
for the public team
bringing in a perspective
of patients,
caregivers, researchers
and then the federal
partners helping guide
that towards
actionable items.
Next slide.
So here are current members
for both the public
and federal components
of the advisory council,
so again, you'll see
we have four subcommittees.
So Research Subcommittee,
the LTSS stands for Long-Term
Support
Services Subcommittee,
Clinical Subcommittee
and Risk Reduction Subcommittee,
and as we'll discuss,
the risk reduction
is a new goal this year,
and really while
there's always been a goal
to prevent and treat
Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias,
this really helps us move
into the public-health space,
try to reduce risk
in a large-scale effort
as Dr. Koroshetz mentioned
with several of the other --
with numerous agencies
making efforts in,
for example,
reduction of hypertension,
increased exercise
and other areas.
Next slide.
So the national plan focuses
on initially five and now,
again, with a new sixth goal,
so goal one is ambitious,
to prevent and effectively
treat Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias
by 2025,
so again, we're coming up
against that benchmark,
but again, I think it's
important for us to step back
and think where we've come,
so again, there's the first...
While controversial, the first
agent has been approved
by the FDA to treat
Alzheimer's disease,
so the first step
in helping us to think
through what kind of research
needs to be done
to help us focus
disease-modifying therapies
and effective treatment
strategies.
And also, how does our health
care system
respond to these agents
being approved?
Do we have the
infrastructure available
to help monitor safety
for patients?
Do we have clinicians
who are trained in diagnosing
and managing patients
to be able to use
these new, novel therapies?
So again, prevention
and treatment
is one of the first goals.
Second goal, again, to enhance
care, quality and efficiency,
so again, it takes research
to do this as well,
and you'll see today the
multi-etiology dementia group,
that there's discussion about,
how do you initially diagnose,
and how do you make sure
that we have the workforce
to provide good care,
quality and efficiency?
The goal three is to support
people
with Alzheimer's-related
dementias and their families,
so again, there's
a caregiving summit
that occurs every third year
in this summit series,
and that came out of NAPA
goals with the need...
understanding that
we need more research
and how to best support people
with dementia
and their families.
Increasing public awareness
and engagement, so again,
we want people to be
a part of these meetings.
We want people to be
a part of NAPA meetings.
If people aren't aware
of dementia,
then they're not going to get in
to get the care that they need.
They're not going to become
a part of clinical trials.
They're not going to spread
the word among their colleagues
and engage
in risk-reduction activity,
so again, these are
very important areas to promote.
And then improving data
to track progress
so that we can see,
how are we doing now,
and how are we doing in the
future with these initiatives?
So accelerating action
to promote healthy aging
and risk reduction
is our new goal,
so again, moving
into public health space
and reducing risk
for these factors
but also needing research
to make sure that we understand,
what are the most promising
risk-reduction factors?
Next slide.
-Two minutes remaining.
-Thank you.
So the...
Again, the summits really
influence the NIH plan by --
the NAPA plan
by really determining
the highest research questions
that can really drive the field
forward and coordinate efforts
and serve as a blueprint
for not only federal programs
but also national programs
outside of the government,
state programs
and international programs.
Next slide.
So what you'll see today
Dr. Corriveau will go over
in more detail next
is that we have
with the ADRD Summit,
as you'll see listed off
to the right,
there are overarching topics
that really impact
all of the different
phases of dementia
and all the different goals
that are addressed,
so under
multiple-etiology dementia,
as mentioned,
we'll be talking about,
how do you diagnose
Alzheimer's?
How do you diagnose
other dementias?
Do we have
the workforce available
to make these diagnoses?
Are we including people
who are at high risk
for the disease
in our clinical trials?
Are we making sure
that a therapy for developing
are effective in all people
in all communities?
Lewy body disease, are we
helping people
to understand frontal
temporal dementia,
Lewy body disease,
vascular contributions?
Do clinicians understand
how to diagnose these?
Do we have the therapies
needed
to specifically treat
these conditions?
And then you'll see that
we'll be talking about today
about new and arising issues,
such as COVID-19,
newer pathologies that have
been discovered,
TDP-43
and also the impact,
which is important to veterans
who I work with,
on post-traumatic brain injury
in people who are risk
for Alzheimer's
and related dementias.
So you'll see that the summit
today really informs
a lot of the goals
that NAPA covers, so next slide.
So again, I encourage people
to stay involved,
provide public comment,
provide feedback,
and then, again, our next
NAPA meeting will be
May 2nd and 3rd, and we'll
address some of the research
and risk-reduction goals
and also hit the highlights
of the last 10 years
and the progress
that's been made,
so thank you for this chance
to share with you
the integration of NAPA
with the summit.
-Wonderful.
Thank you, Dr. Carlsson,
and I also want to mention
that Dr. Carlsson joins us today
in her capacity
as the Chair
of the NAPA Council.
She's also an endowed professor
in Alzheimer's disease
and the Director of the
Wisconsin Alzheimer's Institute,
and so really appreciate you
helping us frame this meeting.
Next slide, please.
I'm just going to focus on
the last point on this slide,
and that is,
under the National Plan
to Address
Alzheimer's Disease,
there's an action item
to regularly convene
on Alzheimer's
Disease-Related Dementia Summit
to consider progress
and research recommendations
to help drive
the field forward.
That's what we're doing today.
This is the fourth
of these summits,
and we take it
very seriously,
and we really want
your input today.
Next slide, please.
So to also put it in context
of how seriously
and the scope
of what we're doing is,
this is a process that has
involved at least 6 months,
probably more of planning
with more than 120 scientists,
physicians and administrators.
I'm the NINDS lead, and Natalia
Rost is our Scientific Chair.
We have a distinguished
steering committee,
including past chairs
of these summits,
and the session committees
are --
just to review them
quickly once more,
multiple-etiology dementias,
health equity in AD/ADRD,
Lewy body dementias,
frontal temporal dementia,
vascular contributions to
cognitive-impairment dementia.
We also have special topics.
This has been a tradition
in the Alzheimer's
Disease-Related
Dementia Summits.
Impact of COVID-19
on AD/ADRD risk
and outcomes is a new topic.
We're also following up on LATE,
TDP-43 pathology
in common, late-onset dementias
and post TBI AD/ADRD.
The goals of the meeting
are really to present
the rationale for the draft
research recommendations
that you will be seeing,
to encourage discussion
amongst stakeholders.
These are, again,
draft recommendations.
We want your input.
We want these recommendations
to be as strong
and as impactful
as they can possibly be.
So we're soliciting feedback,
and this feedback
will be considered
and considered seriously
when drafting the final
draft recommendations.
Next slide, please.
Over the years, funds available
for Alzheimer's
and Alzheimer's
disease-related
dementia research
have increased.
I won't go over the details
of this slide,
but you can see
that there are now considerable
more funds available
now than there were even
5 or 6 years ago.
Next slide, please.
Through our partnership with
the National Institute on Aging,
which leads the NIH's response
to the National Plan
to Address Alzheimer's Disease,
funds are available,
made available to the NINDS
for research,
and the NINDS uses these funds
for investigator-initiated
research
as well as Alzheimer's disease
and Alzheimer's
disease-related dementias
funding opportunity
announcements
that are directed
at specific areas
that are responsible to the
milestones in the national plan
that come from these summits.
Next slide, please.
To illustrate the level
of activity and responsive,
NINDS led 14 new
funding announcements
in fiscal year 2022,
and there are number of them
that are still open,
and there are 14 new NINDS
funding-announcement concepts
that are planned
for fiscal year 2023.
We have an ongoing process.
We work closely within NINDS
and collaboration
with other institutes,
in particular with the NIA,
and we create funding-
opportunity announcements
that are responsive
to workforce
needs as well as research
needs that are detailed here.
Next slide, please.
So these summits set
national research priorities
for the Alzheimer's
disease-related dementias.
Over the years,
we've had 62 NINDS
Alzheimer's disease-related
funding initiatives
that have resulted in major
ADRD programs and consortia,
and you see some of the logos
for those programs
here on this slide.
And NIH ADRD research funding
has increased from 2015 to 2020
to around 600 million
per year at this point.
I'm going to -
In interest of time,
I'm going to not talk about
these programs specifically.
There's a lot of science
to come today,
and I want to be able to move
on to that, so next slide.
Just to give you a quick guide
to the ADRD
draft recommendations,
next slide, please.
As you're look at - looking
at these recommendations
and as the scientific chair
are presenting them
and you're thinking about them
and thinking about
what your input might be -
And please,
use the open mic time,
the question-and-answer time
in this meeting.
Please use it.
Please provide input.
You know, put your name
in the question-and-answer box
that's down
at the middle of your screen,
and let's have
a lively discussion
during the open mic time.
But you'll see that there's
a recommendation number.
There's a prioritization.
Priority one is the highest
level prioritization.
It goes down, two, three four.
Keep in mind, anything that
is mentioned in this summit
as a recommendation is
a very high priority.
There are many, many things that
could have been written up
as recommendations,
but didn't kind of make the
final list for top priorities.
There are timelines that
indicate the number of years
to complete or make
fully operational a goal,
and so this just, I hope,
helps you orient a little bit
to the recommendations
as they're presented.
Next slide, please.
And I would like to introduce
our scientific chair,
Dr. Natalia Rost.
Thank you.
-Thank you, Rod.
It is my great pleasure
and privilege
to be part of this initiative,
which is, as you know,
critical to
scientific progress in dementia
but more importantly
in translating this science
into clinical practice
of diagnosis, treatment
and most importantly
prevention of dementia
in the U.S. and worldwide,
so next slide.
So these are my disclaimer
and disclosures.
Next slide?
I would like to begin
with a global view
of why our work here
is so important
and remind everyone that
despite the recent advances,
there is certainly
much more to be done,
and I find this
recent map generated
by the Global Burden
of Disease Collaborative
of estimated percent
change of dementia
prevalence to be
a very effective tool
to demonstrate
the ongoing challenge.
Even with some reports of,
so to speak,
flattening the curve
and, in dementia incidents
in some regions of the world,
according to this report,
there is still uniformly
projected growth
in prevalence of dementia cases
expected between 2019 and 2050
with the estimated
percent-change variant
anywhere between 20
to 40-percent increase
as the smallest and up
to 2000-percent increase
in some regions,
with the U.S. projected
to be in 80
to 100-percent increase by 2050.
Next slide.
But despite the need for global
vigilance with this issue,
as clinician-scientists,
our focus is always
on individual patients,
a focus that has always guided
the principles
of dementia science,
our North Star,
so to speak,
from bedside to bench
and back to bedside,
and our patients' questions
like, "What is happening to me?"
lead to development
of cutting-edge diagnostics.
Questions like, "Why is it
happening?" and "Why now?"
lead us to pursue
some deep understanding
of basic mechanisms
of disease.
When patients
and their families ask,
"Where do we go
from here?"
we seek novel interventions,
we test support systems,
and we forge ahead
with clinical trials,
and when our patients ask,
"Am I going to be all right?"
we develop
prognostication tools,
a screening test and employ
robust support systems.
Next slide.
But the task at hand
remains quite complex,
as you know.
There's been a fascinating
evolution of dementia
as a clinical syndrome concept,
especially over the few past
decades with the accumulation
of knowledge
about underlying
disease pathology,
you know, variability
of clinical features,
molecular genetics
and environmental interactions
as well,
and while science
continues to evolve,
prior dogmas, like "One
pathology equals one disease,"
are rapidly changing
and understanding evolves
that multiple pathways may lead
to a clinical dementia syndrome.
Next slide.
Furthermore, we'll learn that,
on the wide spectrum
between brain health
on one end and brain disease
such as AD and ADRD
on the other,
there is literally
a lifetime where,
at every stage of our individual
chronological lifespan,
including influences
that occurred
during brain development,
there are innate as well
as environmental factors
that impact the risk
of developing dementia
at a later stage.
Most of these life stages are,
of course, arbitrary,
and manufactures,
in part, their influence
across their entire life,
of course, including those
that have cumulative effects,
such as health disparities
related to historic
societal structures.
Next slide.
So unsurprisingly, to overcome
the complexities
of AD and ADRD
as a disease process,
our approach to science
has to remain nimble,
robust and informed
by patient experiences,
and to stay on mission,
we must bring together
diverse expertise,
close-cutting science
and the perpetual cycle
of innovation, collaboration
and communication in research,
and this is what 2022
ADRD Summit is all about.
After almost six -
more than 6 months
of intense preparations,
we're excited to present to you
a product
of our scientific workgroups.
Next slide.
So by the way, a brief
introduction, as an example,
the top priorities
to be discussed by
the Health Equity
in AD/ADRD group,
led by Dr. González
and Zissimopoulos,
are to advance equity in AD
and ADRD research
via inclusion science
and to expand the AD and the
ADRD scientific workforce
of persons historically
underrepresented in science.
Next slide.
The Frontotemporal Degeneration
group,
led by Doctors Boxer and Karch
will provide the rationale
for their top-priority
recommendations
of understanding
FTD epidemiology and genetics
in diverse populations
and in advancing
understanding of FTD
with a goal of identifying
therapeutic targets.
Next slide.
VCID group, cochaired
by Doctors Wilcock and Petersen
will present their top
priority recommendations
to establish and refine
experimental models
and technologies to identify
disease-relevant mechanisms
and to develop
and validate markers of VCID
in diverse populations.
Next slide.
Lewy Body Dementias group,
led by Dr. Leverenz
and Kantarci,
will share their top-priority
recommendations
including the need
for clinical trials to alleviate
or slow the course of LBD
while continuing to work
on delineate genetic loci
and their functions
that contribute
to the onset
and progression of LBD.
Next slide.
On day two, the Multiple
Etiology Dementias group,
led by Dr. Possin, continues
its work on high priority
to evaluate pragmatic approaches
to detect cognitive impairment
and moving conducting
clinical studies
on a proofed
or promising interventions
to mitigate
cognitive decline.
Next slide.
In this Special Topics
from the 2019 summit, post-TBI,
AD and ADRD and TDP-43 in Common
Late-Onset Dementias or LATE,
as you will learn
later in day two,
will present
their top priorities
of promoting collaboration
among TBI
and dementia researchers
and defining late classification
and diagnostic boundaries
respectively.
Next slide.
And finally, I wanted to
highlight the topic
that we have been
very anxious to bring forward
for your consideration
at this summit,
and it's the topic that clearly
dominated our discussions
over the past two years:
the impact of COVID-19 pandemic
on risk
and outcomes of AD and ADRD.
Clearly, a topic that
is truly worthy
of an emerging science
topic status in 2022.
Next slide.
As we all know, there are nearly
80 million COVID-19 survivors
in the U.S. alone,
and what we as clinicians learn
from beginning of this pandemic
is that neurological,
neuropsychiatric and cognitive
complaints are common
in those suffering from COVID
and in survivors.
We have learned that
SARS-CoV-2 infection has acute
and long-term effects
on the brain
and that there are
multiple mechanisms
by which the virus
can cause the damage,
including the potential
downstream effects
on neurodegenerative
and vascular injury pathways,
and while the overall impact
on AD and ADRD risk
and outcomes
and is not yet known.
Potential detrimental effects
may include increase
in incidents of cognitive
impairment in dementia cases,
accelerated course
of cognitive decline
among already diagnosed
with AD and ADRD diagnosis,
accelerated neurodegeneration
and vascular pathologies
in the brain
among currently symptomatic,
shift in the population timeline
of cognitive decline
toward younger ages
and increased incidents
of early-onset dementias
and unfortunately,
increased mortality
among those
with advanced dementia.
-One minute remaining.
-At this time, however,
the data is still scarce and
knowledge is rapidly evolving,
but even in this
very early stage,
the impact
of SARS-CoV-2 infection
on the brain can be detected,
as in, for example,
this recent study published
by the UK Biobank on the left,
examining brain MRI
in 400 patients
who tested positive for COVID-19
between their two scans
or the effects
of the pandemic
on the newer psychiatric
symptoms of dementia patients,
and notably their caretakers,
as shown by a recent
international collaboration
on the right.
So we have a lot of questions
to answer in the future
as related
to this special topic,
and I'm delighted that our
newly formed working group,
cochaired with me
by Dr. Sudha Seshadri,
will present to you our initial
set of recommendations tomorrow.
Next slide.
Next slide.
But for now, I would like
to welcome you again
to the 2022 ADRD Summit,
and I hope you
all take advantage
of the open microphone
sessions after each topic
like all of my colleagues
urge you to.
This is, after all,
an open forum,
and we would like
to have a robust dialogue
or as robust as possible,
and thank you in advance
for your contribution.
So we're on time,
and without further ado,
I would like to welcome
Doctors Hector González
and Dr. Julie Zissimopoulos,
cochairs of the Health Equity
in AD and ADRD group,
who will kick off
our scientific session program.
Welcome.
-Thank you.
On behalf of our health
equity panel,
I thank Dr. Koroshetz,
Corriveau
and the organizers
for bringing our topic area
to the forefront of the
2022 Alzheimer's Disease
and Related Dementias Summit.
As a panel, we appreciate
this opportunity
to further scientific attention
and commitment
toward achieving
Alzheimer's disease
and related dementia
health equity through research.
In this health equity model -
Next, please.
Oops, those are my disclosures.
Nothing to report.
In this health equity model,
dementia disparities
are apparent in later life,
but we know this,
and we've known this for years,
as Dr. Rost
had mentioned before.
The big and unanswered
questions are, "Why?
Why do these AD/ADRD
disparities exist,
and when in the life course
did they begin?"
and most importantly,
"How do we resolve
the major public health problems
facing so many underrepresented
minority communities?"
Some key implementation
questions include,
"Does the scientific community
have the tools necessary?
If not, then what
research infrastructure
is needed to achieve
research equity?"
To address these questions,
we recommend moving
beyond disparities
and to seek new
and innovative ways
to achieve health equity
through our research.
Ethnic racial differences
can only tell us
that the disparities exist
but not the means
for achieving health equity.
As this life-course model
suggests, within-group research
can tell us the origins
and sources of the problems
and promising means for
resolving AD/ADRD disparities.
Next slide, please.
As we - We as an ADRD health
equity panel
were tasked
with providing recommendations
for achieving health
equity through research.
Our panelists -
Our health equity panelists
responded to the challenge
by recommending four focus areas
shown in these rectangles
on the slide here.
First and foremost,
our panelists agreed
that growing a diverse
and committed
scientific workforce
is needed for achieving
AD/ADRD health equity.
As shown here, the workforce
encompasses and forms
a basic substrate
for achieving health
equity goals of
the other focus areas within.
Appropriate
assessment tools and data
from underrepresented
minority communities
is still
woefully lacking.
Important data,
for example, genomics,
are largely unavailable,
as it was mentioned before,
which means
that underrepresented
minority communities
have been left out of recent
advances in biomarkers,
genomics, neuroimaging and other
cutting-edge areas of research.
Additionally,
replication studies so important
for scientific rigor
are nearly impossible,
thereby compounding
research inequalities.
Epidemiologic research progress
is hampered
by a lack of basic tools
that are largely nonexistent
for underrepresented
minority communities.
Randomized clinical trials
have been large -
have largely omitted
underrepresented minority
communities
and so are so statistically
underpowered
that inferences
to non-white communities are,
at best, inconclusive.
Ultimately, the inequalities
in available research tools
and data
for underrepresented communities
affects patient
care and quality,
which is compounded by
the inaccessibility of health
care to so many underrepresented
minority communities.
So moving forward, next,
Dr. Luis Medina.
Next slide, please.
Dr. Luis Medina will provide the
workforce panels recommendations
for achieving
Alzheimer's disease
and related dementia
health equity through research.
Thank you very much.
-Hi, everyone.
I'm delighted to be here.
For the next few minutes,
Dr. Medina and myself
will talk about the importance
of a diverse
and inclusive workforce
trained in health equity.
Next slide, please.
As you can see in this slide,
the views that we're expressing
are not those
of the NIH or NINDS,
and we have received funding,
both Dr. Medina and myself,
from the NIH
and the Alzheimer's Association.
Next slide, please.
So workforce diversity
is critical.
It drives innovation.
It helps facilitate
the translation
of scientific findings
and results
into advances in health,
and it prepares the healthcare
professional workforce
to better care for our
increasingly diverse population,
and this includes
the population over age 65,
so the age [Indistinct]
really relevant when we're
discussing AD and ADRD.
Next slide, please?
With that in mind,
I want to describe,
a bit, the current state of
workforce diversity in the U.S.,
and as you can see
in this figure,
the percent of individuals
who identify as Black,
African-American,
Hispanic, Latino,
American Indian or Alaska Native
in science and engineering field
has grown
across all degrees,
so those three lines
with the different degrees,
since 1993.
However, they are
underrepresented
when you look
at the occupations
because they account for only
29 percent of the science
and engineering workforce,
while they represent 52 percent
of U.S. residents above age 21,
and this underrepresentation
also exists when we look at -
through our PIs of R01s
and R01-equivalent awards.
In 2020, only 6.7 percent
of PIs of those types of grants
identified as Hispanic, Latino,
Black or African-American.
This means that the workforce
not only
doesn't reflect
the diversity of the U.S.,
but it also means that the
workforce doesn't reflect
those most affected
by AD and ADRD,
which disproportionately affects
minoritized populations.
Next slide, please.
Though the prior slide focused
on racial and ethnic diversity,
there are many
additional domains to consider
when we're talking
about a diverse workforce,
and that includes but is
not limited to dimensions
such as sex, gender, age,
socioeconomic status
and many other aspects
that affect people's
lived experiences.
An inclusive
and diverse workforce
brings additional perspectives.
It promotes creativity,
and it broadens
the research question -
the research scope by
including more questions
or encouraging more questions
because it's critical
and essential
when thinking about
health equity research.
Studies have found that
diverse groups
produce more paper
and that those papers
are cited more often,
and this is valuable as a proxy
to show that they are -
There's increasing knowledge
and quality knowledge,
and this, in turn,
hopefully, is knowledge
that can be used
to promote health equity.
In his research, Dr. Scott Page
stated that diverse
groups of problem
solvers consistently
outperformed groups of the best
and the brightest.
Next slide, please?
Additionally, a representative
workforce
that aligns with the diverse
communities is important
because it facilitates
better commute -
communication between
researchers and the community.
It can help mitigate
implicit bias.
It increases enrollment
and can increase retention.
Both of those are
really critical.
It can also lead
to greater validity of data.
Again, this is really valuable
because it helps expand
our knowledge,
enabling us
to promote health equity.
I now let Dr. Medina take over.
-Next slide, please.
And so as - Some of the work
that's come out of
NIH,
some wonderful tool kits,
as I'll show in one
of the upcoming slides,
but Dr. Marie Bernard
even cited,
"As a woman of color
in science,
I have seen the missed
opportunities to take advantage
of this full spectrum
of scientific talent.
It is profoundly important
for all members
of the biomedical workforce
to feel included,
welcomed, supported
and that they have a fair
and equal opportunity
to pursue their passion
for research
and scientific discovery.
Our institutions and society
must take steps
to eliminate threats
that create barriers
such as structural racism,
incivility,
harassment and bias."
Next slide, please.
And so how do we address
these issues
and these potential barriers?
There are several resources
from the NIH,
as well as outside
the NIH,
including the Scientific
Workforce Diversity
Toolkit to help address some
of these workforce disparities.
There are various
administrative supplements
and other notices
of special interest
that have been announced to help
address some of these issues,
including this one relating
to recognizing excellence
in diversity, equity, inclusion
and accessibility.
Various funding opportunities
for individuals
have various training levels,
including K99/R00 opportunities
but also F31s,
F32s for individuals
in their graduate training
or in their
post-doctoral training,
as well as the National
Research Mentoring Network
to help, again, address some
of these workforce disparities.
Next slide, please.
And so before I provide
the recommendations
from our
particular workforce, workgroup,
we highlight this here, which is
that workforce diversity
is critical to aspects
of science of AD
and ADRD,
from neurons to nations,
as it affects the quality
of the data collected,
the knowledge accumulated
and representativeness
of future research
and the workforce pipeline.
Next slide, please.
So with that, our recommendation
to increase
training support and capacity
of an AD/ADRD
scientific workforce
or persons
historically underrepresented
in biomedical, behavioral
and social sciences;
suggest that we leverage
existing diverse AD/ADRD
health equity research
groups and organizations,
that we partner with
relevant stakeholders
to invest in promising trainees
early in the pipeline;
that we enhance existing
systems for tracking
and monitoring progress
in diversification
of the AD/ADRD
scientific workforce;
that we incentivize
mentors and institutions
to sponsor training awards
for underrepresented scholars,
target training mechanisms,
writing workshops
and other
career-development resources
to support underrepresented
scientists is also recommended.
Next slide, please.
In order to promote career
development
of biomedical, behavioral
and social scientists
conducting AD/ADRD
health equity research,
we suggest and recommend
an iterative training framework
for ADRD health
equity research be used;
that we retool and expand
the knowledge base
on conducting
inclusive science
of mid-career
and senior scientists,
again, highlighting the need
to address
these issues across
the training spectrum;
that we require
training and education
in health equity
principles for all scholars;
that provide training
and education
in health equity research
to all grant reviewers;
that we increase participation
on study sections of scientists
with expertise
in health equity research,
including individuals
who are members
of underrepresented populations
and that we increase
opportunities for participation
in high-level decision-making
committees and opportunities
for underrepresented
scholars.
Next slide, please.
The NIH is already addressing
some of these issues.
In addition to some of the
resources that I showed earlier,
we see special calls
for understanding
and addressing the impact
of structural racism
and discrimination on minority
health and health disparities,
this particular R01 opportunity,
the Health Disparities
Research Institute
and these administrative
supplements for research
on sexual and gender
minority populations,
as well as other opportunities
not listed here.
Next slide, please?
Now, I will hand it over
to our moderators.
Thank you.
-Yes, next is the assessment
and data
focus area recommendations
that I believe Dr. Gottesman
will be presenting.
-I'll be taking -
I'll be taking over.
Good morning, all.
On behalf of my colleagues,
I want to thank the NINDS
for putting this summit together
and providing us the opportunity
to share our thoughts
on how to advance health equity
through AD/ADRD research.
My name is Wassim Tarraf,
and I'll be presenting on behalf
of my colleagues in the data
and assessment focus area,
including Dr. Gottesman,
Dr. O'Bryant, Dr. Fornage
and Dr. González.
Next slide, please?
I have no conflicts to report.
Next slide, please.
So over the next few slides,
I'm going to try to make
a few observations
to place in context -
discussions as a group,
leading to our recommendations.
As you probably know,
the U.S. population is becoming
increasingly more diverse,
but ethnic and racial groups
remain underrepresented
in clinical trials,
which are, as an example,
the primary pathway for
the development of therapeutics,
so scientists need
more resources to understand
and bring down the barriers
to participation
in clinical trials for these
underrepresented groups.
We've made progress over time,
and the rates of participation
for traditionally
underrepresented groups
have increased,
but these rates
still do not fully represent
the overall population
of the United States.
As you see here, as of 2013,
72 percent of clinical
trial participants
were non-Hispanic whites,
and among ethnic
and racial minorities
that do participate
in clinical trials,
the rates vary drastically
by the groups included.
This lack of representation
has critical implications
to the health
and well-being of racial
and ethnic minorities
but also
the general population.
A better understanding
of the factors
that affect these groups
can shed light on novel pathways
that will have implications
for the overall public health.
So existing policies
do recognize this as an issue,
and there are many efforts
to increase
the representation of minorities
in clinical trials,
but policy alone
is insufficient to overcome
some of these existing
barriers to inclusion.
We believe that the science
of inclusion
plays a critical role in how
to improve representation,
and over the next few years,
we believe that we should
continue to invest in programs
that increase the awareness
and visibility
of the science
of recruitment,
establish AD/ADRD
diversity recruitment
and retention centers
and build accountability
mechanisms for recruitment goals
within existing
NIH-funded networks.
Establishing these processes
can potentially bring
about this
meaningful participation
of all population groups
and yield potential gains
to improve the public health.
Next slide, please?
So the statistics that you seen
on the previous slide
also extend
to observational data.
What you see here is a breakdown
of some data
provided by the NIH
RCDC Inclusion
Statistics Report.
These figures, to a large
extent,
mirror the story that we've -
was told in
the clinical trials case.
It is critical to point here
that there's significant
variability across institutes,
and all institutes
are making progress,
but more is needed
to advance the process
and provide the data
that is required to allow
appropriate generalizability
to a diversely aging population.
Next slide, please?
So moving beyond disparities
and towards equity,
as the chair of many - and many
other speakers have emphasized -
And proving participation
for better representation
has the potential
to yield better data,
and that can help improve
assessment tools,
better measures,
better quantification
and better studies
for pathways to ADRD
and will enhance
the generalizability
and equity
of scientific research.
On the cognitive
assessment front,
we have ample evidence
from years of studies
that existing cutoffs
on cognitive tests
have major shortcomings
for epidemiological estimates
of disease
across racial and ethnic groups,
across socioeconomic
status groups,
particularly across
educational level groups,
and we have clear calls
and supportive efforts
to create better tools
and invest scientific efforts
to identify metrics
that allow
appropriate generalization.
So this includes generating
the deep data
that we need that could enable
stratification by race,
ethnicity, by education, by SES
and ensure better detection,
particularly at early stages
of disease,
example,
mild cognitive impairment,
but also critically to permit
clear demarcation
across disease stages
across and within groups.
Unfortunately, we're not
at that level of data yet.
The point and our view
is made clear
by looking at recent reviews
of the evidence,
which you see
on the slide here,
that shows that data
for some groups, as an example,
American Indians
or Alaska Natives
to note one,
is near nonexistent.
Data on other groups,
while we have some,
is potentially insufficient
to provide precise estimates
of the problem,
particularly at the earlier
stages of the disease process,
and this evidence also points
that there's a clear need
to generate data
that allows disaggregation
of large
race-ethnic classifications,
among Asian Americans,
among Black Americans,
among Hispanic Americans,
to kind of disentangle
this heterogeneity
within these large
non-monolithic groups.
So given the state
of the evidence,
we recommend a national effort
for developing novel
and unbiased normative methods
that will lay the ground
for recommendations,
for guidelines
and for guidance on how
and when to use
or not to use race
or ethnic-based norms
in cognitive data.
Next slide, please.
On the biomarkers and
the evidence base
regarding availability,
let alone equivalency
of AD/ADRD biomarkers,
is even much thinner
than what's available
for cognitive assessment.
For example, recent study
looking at screening
and enrollments
in the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI,
shows that of
the enrolled participants
between 2004 and 2020,
only 11 percent of the data
came from individuals
that identified
as being from ethnoculturally
underrepresented populations
and only 15 percent
from individuals
with less than
12 years of education.
Both of these rates
are drastically lower
than what comparative
census data
would allow
for these categories.
Now serious observers
of the field of AD
and ADRD biomarkers recognize
that this is an exciting time
to be doing research in AD
and ADRD with,
you know, potential tools
at our disposal
that have the promise,
as was mentioned,
of better understanding
complex pathologies,
transforming care
and diagnostics
and even disease monitoring.
But despite this excitement,
there's also clear recognition
that there are critical
shortcomings in existing data
and clear limitations
in the lack of diversity
of existing data
which limits the potential
for extending any findings
to real-world clinical problems.
So the figure that you see
on this slide
provides some hints
from existing data.
These data are largely limited
in terms of representation
based on small n,
but they show that biomarkers
of AD
present in complex ways
across population groups
and are likely to differ
by race and ethnicity.
So planning for achieving equity
in AD and ADRD research
is the only way, in our view,
to avoid neglecting,
leaving behind, omitting major
sections of the US populations
and potentially jeopardizing
the public health
for future generations.
We recommend developing
resources to address
the fundamental questions
of biomarker equivalency
in distinct race
and ethnic groups,
to explore alternative
frameworks,
recognizing that
the ATN framework
may not apply as well in
diverse populations
given the lack,
as an example,
for considerations
of cardiovascular disease,
misdistribution
of the population.
And biomarkers may have
different meaning and value
in different groups.
Next slide, please.
We think also that
a similar story comes up
when we look at the evidence
for genetic data.
So research finding suggest
that even for relatively
simple links,
as in the APOE epsilon 4 story,
when more data
becomes available,
it shows more complexity.
And it shows that conclusive
evidence still alludes us
until more sampling
and higher levels of inclusion
to clarify the potential of
within group heterogeneities
and links
and the synergistic effects
that could happen within groups.
But also it shows a particular
need for availability of data
that enables replication.
We think that better and more
inclusive data
will open doors for discovery.
It'll enable newer and more
nuanced ways
of thinking about the pathways.
And to get there,
we recommend enhancing
the availability
of studies
that better characterize
genetic risk factors,
particularly in the context
of other nongenetic factors.
So our view is that any genetic
discovery,
in order to translate
the real-world benefits,
need to be examined
in the context of environmental,
behavioral and socioeconomic
cultural factors
in order to have
the data necessary
to allow these kinds
of associations.
Next slide, please.
-Two minutes remaining.
-In the interest of time,
the excitement about the
potential of new technologies
and their capacities
for collecting rich,
almost instantaneous data
through digital biomarkers
to improve the health
of Americans is tremendous.
The question, however,
in our view is, which Americans?
And the hope is that we're not
setting ourselves up
for a new wave
of scientific excitement
that passes underrepresented
populations.
I want to thank you
for the opportunity
to share some of our stats,
and it is now my pleasure
to pass the baton
to Dr. Khachaturian.
Thank you.
-Thank you, Dr. Tarraf.
Hello, my name
is Ara Khachaturian,
and I'm representing
the focus area on diagnosis,
treatment and care.
These are recommendations
for four and eight.
Next slide, please.
These are my disclaimers,
and this is my disclosure.
Next slide.
I want to acknowledge
that our focus area
included
Dr. Julie Zissimopoulos,
Dr. Erica Littlejohn,
Dr. Alberto Ramos
and also, Dr. Michael Wolf.
We really took upon
this question
of looking at the issues
of diagnosis, treatment
and care in terms
of really thinking about
from broadly the patient journey
when one has Alzheimer's
or a related dementia
as well as also
thinking about,
what it's going to take
to have new quote, unquote,
learning health systems
of the future
and how are we actually
going to arrive
at providing equitable
care for individuals,
particularly from
underrepresented
and underserved populations.
Our first recommendation,
recommendation four,
is to assess the social,
economic, structural impediments
to equity in Alzheimer's
and Alzheimer's-related
disorders assessment,
diagnosis and referrals
and impacts on health
and economic outcomes.
Within this recommendation,
there's really an opportunity
to think about several
important research questions,
public health questions
and public policy questions.
We're going to take a look
at some of those questions.
These are not exhaustive,
but really illustrative.
Next slide, please.
We think that these questions
are really going to be
sort of examined more critically
and perhaps even really become
sort of dominating
the literature
over the next 3
to 5 years.
One if these first questions is,
how does CMS and private
insurance benefit designs,
payment and reimbursement
policies impact the assessment,
diagnosis of dementia
in diverse populations?
We know that there is
an ongoing tension
in the US health care system
about how best
to enhance quality care.
In one way, this question seeks
to pinpoint those opportunities
to gain efficiencies
in the US health care system.
Next slide, please.
Another important question
for supporting
this recommendation is,
how generalizable are provider
and specific health
system factors?
This will include access
to dementia specialists,
the role of race concordance
and also other providers
and practice-level
organization factors
among diverse populations.
Next slide, please.
This question, what socio-,
behavioral and environmental
and economic health
care system factors
impede equitable assessment
and detection and diagnosis
and referrals of individuals
with Alzheimer's
and related disorders?
Next slide, please.
And the related question of,
how best to quantify
the assessment, detection,
diagnosis and referrals
on health,
social and economic outcomes?
As Dr. Tarraf had mentioned
in the previous outcome --
in the previous presentation,
there is very much an important
need for new data
and new assessments.
As our group thought
about these questions,
we really were thinking
in terms of both
from how public health
and information sciences
can come together
to really think
about looking at these questions
from a complexity point of view,
thinking about that
there are complex interactions,
and certainly many
of these related factors
are not going to be linear.
In fact, how are we going
to be able to think
about
modeling nonlinear relationships
across these various measures.
And certainly, this is going
to be proved to be
very important
over the next couple of years.
Next slide, please.
So our group sort of went from
asking these questions,
important questions
of how to really look
at the issues of diagnosis,
treatment and care
to really provide better
assurance for health equity,
to thinking about this
from a structural point of view
and really looking at
what are going to be
some of the tools and methods
that are going to help drive
exploration of these questions.
So recommendation eight looks at
and makes the recommendation
that we need to support
infrastructure and policy
research
to understand individuals,
community and societal drivers
of inequities
in cost of and access
to treatments, care
and the impact on Alzheimer's
and Alzheimer's-related
disorders outcomes.
Next slide, please.
This recommendation really sort
of points
to what are going to be
some of the specific needs
that we're going to
have to think about.
So our group actually started
to think in terms of,
how can we start to go
from this recommendation stage
to an implementation?
One of the ideas was really
in terms of trying
to define one's concepts.
Certainly having national
standards for dementia costs
and health outcomes is going
to be absolutely imperative.
Dr. González, in his opening
remarks to this session,
really sort of laid out
the NINDS framework.
And so, one of the ideas that we
hope that perhaps future
working groups will look at is,
how to parameterize
some of these key
constructs in terms of
looking at how to model better
and also to think
about inclusion
into a national data repository.
And that really leads
to our third point here,
which is a national database
for dementia equity research
on social, economic
and health-related factors.
Next slide, please.
We also seek to think that
it's going to be very important
to have measures to look at
inequities in pharmacological,
non-pharmacological, medical
and social care services,
with a focus looking at impact
on cost and health outcomes.
Also, health outcomes and care
quality of managed care
and associated access
among diverse populations
is going to be another
important area to examine.
Next slide, please.
Looking at this thoroughly from
the health economic perspective,
supply-side factors
are also going to be
an important area to measure.
This is going to require looking
at health system ownership,
for example,
of physician practices
and also looking at the equity
of Medicare benefit plans.
Another idea
that we discussed as well
is this adoption of something
called the model-base.
Here, the idea would be
to actually not
just have data available,
but really to have
a collection of models,
health economic models
of pharmacological,
non-pharmacological
and health care interventions
that will help measure
and predict access,
costs and health
care outcomes.
And next slide, please.
And finally, we are really
interested in seeing
what is going to happen
in terms of the examine
of sociocultural, behavioral,
environmental, health
and other care system factors
that will influence
equitable access.
This is a topic that certainly
is beginning to gain
a lot of interest
within journals,
and we really anticipate
seeing a lot of this research
coming forward
over perhaps even shorter
than the 5 to 7 years
that we anticipate.
And as noted by Dr. Rost
also at the beginning
of the presentation,
the impact of COVID in terms
of what that has meant
to our health care systems
in terms
of delivering better diagnosis,
treatment and care,
certainly telemedicine
and mobile health care options
on reducing
some of the financial burdens
and some of
the communications problems
are going to be
absolutely essential.
Next slide.
Thank you, and I'd like to now
introduce my colleague,
Professor Jennifer Weuve
at Boston University
School of Public Health,
who's going to be talking about
the focus area on epidemiology.
-Thank you, Ara.
I will be summarizing
recommendations
that address how to use
epidemiology to understand
and intervene
on health inequities in AD/ADRD.
Next.
I have no disclosures to report.
Next.
Our first recommendation
concerns the documentation
of health inequities
in AD/ADRD.
Specifically, we recommend
applying existing and novel
surveillance methods
to assess inequities
in AD/ADRD prevalence,
incidence, diagnosis,
treatment and care.
We also advocate attention
to trends in inequities.
That is, how inequities
might be changing over time,
whether shrinking
or expanding.
Next.
Now, acts of documentation
are integral
to achieving health
equity in AD/ADRD
by informing
public health priorities,
as well as prevention
and treatment strategies.
Now, some inequities have
already been quantified,
but many remain unknown.
For example, numerous studies
have reported declines
in dementia incidence rates,
but most of these studies
focused
on non-Latinx white persons
in the US and Europe.
Little has been reported
about whether dementia incidence
has been falling
in underrepresented populations
or in other
geographic regions.
Next.
Now, in addition to more
attention on trends,
we recommend that inequities
be estimated
across a range of social
determinants of health,
such as across racialized group
or indices of
neighborhood environment,
and as for explaining
those inequities,
we directly address this
in our second recommendation.
Still, the very monitoring
of inequities in AD/ADRD
can reveal impacts of historic
and contemporary policies
and events, such as civil rights
policy and pandemics.
Next.
Now, I've outlined the nature
of inequities in AD/ADRD
that we recommend monitoring,
and now to the how.
Now, valid estimates
of inequities
should come from samples
that are representative
of the US population,
but we can expand
what useful representativeness
means beyond proportions
that are consistent
with the US census.
Many smaller or minoritized
or marginalized groups
will need to be oversampled
to provide adequate numbers
for accurate
and precise estimates.
Historically, cohort studies
of AD/ADRD
have underincluded specific
communities and populations,
as you've heard.
And as a result,
adequately estimating
the experience of AD/ADRD
in these communities
may require
establishing new cohorts.
New cohorts combined
with other methods
may also be helpful
in shedding light
on prevalence and incidence
of rare dementias
in previously
underrepresented groups.
Next.
And whether the cohort
is established or new,
to make it useful for accurately
gauging inequities,
investigators must identify
and act on determinants
of underinclusion
in these cohorts...
[Audio drop]
-Dr. Weuve,
your microphone is muted.
-Yeah, I'm not sure
how that happened.
My apologies.
I'm going to start here.
And whether the cohort
is established or new,
to make it useful for accurately
gauging inequities,
investigators must identify
and act
on determinants of
underinclusion in these cohorts,
as you've heard.
Now, the levers of inclusion
could involve aspects
of recruitment
and retention practices,
economic barriers and stigma,
for example.
Now, some key levers may lie
outside
investigator's own experience
and imagination,
and developing the capacity
to appreciate them and act
on them may require
intentional acts of partnership
and engagement
with communities.
Next.
Our second recommendation that
uses the tools of epidemiology
concerns determining how health
inequities in AD/ADRD occur.
Specifically, we recommend
identifying life course
and multilevel mechanisms of
pathways to AD/ADRD inequities
and use the discoveries
to reduce these inequities.
Next.
As a foundational act
of that recommendation,
we encourage researchers
to make a standard practice
in their research
on inequities in AD/ADRD
to disclose the conceptual model
that is guiding their work.
Some broad examples include
race as a social construct
or even defining age-group
cohorts to specific places,
times and even policy.
Now, the absence of such
a disclosure
can leave open the door
for interpretations
that veer
toward bioessentialism.
Next.
Among populations
facing inequities in AD/ADRD,
we suggest that putative
risk factors AD/ADRD inequities
be measured over several
dimensions of time, for example,
over the life course
across generations
and specific risk periods,
and that these risk factors be
assessed in relation to AD/ADRD
or well-known
determinants of AD/ADRD.
Next.
The interplay between social,
environmental
and biological mechanisms
in producing AD/ADRD inequities
is multidimensional
and, as a result,
likely to be complicated.
This complicated interplay
can be evaluated
with new intentionally
designed AD/ADRD
cohorts
for harmonization efforts.
Next.
Now, this figure,
based on the work
of Bailey and colleagues,
illustrates the potential
complexity of mechanisms
leading to inequities
in AD/ADRD.
You can see multiple and
nested mechanistic domains
represented here, from policy
structures to phenotype.
And these are all
implicitly embedded
in various dimensions
of time.
Next.
The studies of the mechanisms
of and pathways
to AD/ADRD inequities
might also examine the extent
to which excess risk
in AD/ADRD is intersectional,
for example,
involving combinations of race
and gender or race
and education.
This is another line of evidence
that can be generated
with sufficiency large
or oversampled populations.
And to the point
of this research,
we encourage researchers to work
toward translating discoveries
in this domain
to the underrepresented groups
and/or regions
from which they are drawn.
And finally, age-related
disorders, such a AD/ADRD,
disproportionately affect
those among us
who may be marginalized,
stigmatized
and underrepresented.
So clearly, these disorders
are not agnostic
to the structures
and cascades of inequity.
And as long as inequities exist
in our societies,
it is imperative for researchers
to document them,
identify the determinants
and strive to resolve them.
And thank you so much.
I turn over the platform
to Dr. Zissimopoulos.
-Oh, thank you so much.
Thank you to our speakers
for your excellent
presentations.
My name is Julie Zissimopoulos.
I serve as cochair
with Dr. Hector González
over the Health Equity
in Alzheimer's Disease
and Alzheimer's Diseased-Related
Dementias Working Group.
It is my privilege to briefly
summarize
the recommendations
of the working group
and present
our priority order.
Next slide, please.
The views do not reflect
the official policy of NINDS
or NIH.
I receive funding from the NIA
and no other relevant financial
relationship disclosed.
Next slide, please.
In driving final
recommendations,
we built from prior year
recommendations,
insights from research
and patient care
and a framework
for achieving health equity
that considers life
course health,
socioeconomic historical policy
and place-based factors,
that may act as barriers
to or opportunities
for achieving health equity.
We identified four focus areas
with distinctive significance
for health equity
in Alzheimer's Disease
and Related Dementias
through research, workforce,
data and assessment,
epidemiology and diagnosis,
treatment and care.
You just heard two
recommendations
aligned with each focus area
from our experts
from the Health Equity
Working Group.
I will now present
our prioritization
of these recommendations
in a summarized form.
Our priority one recommendation
is establish
the high importance of actions
that increase participation
of underrepresented groups
in clinical trials.
We also addressed
the significance of a diverse
workforce for building knowledge
and capability
to achieve our goal
of health equity.
Our priority two recommendations
emphasize educating
and retooling scientists
across the biomedical,
behavioral
and social science fields,
for achieving excellence
in health equity research.
We also recommend new research
into impediments
to equitable assessments,
diagnosis and referrals,
as well as the health
and economic consequences
of inequities in accurate
and timely diagnoses.
Our priority three
recommendations address
the need for biomarkers,
assessment tools and methods
that are applicable to different
racial and ethnic groups
and how improvements
to them provide opportunities
for advancing equitable
scientific research.
Similarly, a second priority
three recommends
complementing the existing
but limited surveillance methods
for assessing inequities
with novel ones
to inform risk reduction,
prevention and treatment
strategies.
And finally, our priority
four recommendations focus
on how inequities occur.
They propose establishing
conceptual models
for identifying the health,
socioeconomic historical policy
in place-based mechanisms
that are producing inequities
and also in risk
and also the inequities
in the cost of disease
and access to care and
social services and treatment.
They recommend new data
and improved methods
for quantifying inequities
and the consequences
of those inequities.
Before turning to the open
microphone discussion,
and on behalf of
Dr. Hector González and myself,
I want to thank
the summit organizers,
our speakers and all
the working group members
and the participants here today.
Now, I invite all Health Equity
Working Group
panelists to turn
on their cameras
for the open
microphone discussion.
Dr. Hector González will
invite participants by name,
and in the order
that we receive the question,
to turn on their cameras and
verbally ask their questions.
Following this, panelists
may indicate their interest
in responding via the chat
or verbally,
and Dr. González
will invite you to respond.
Dr. González, I turn the session
back over to you.
-Dr. Zissimopoulos,
thank you very much.
And now we go to the open
mic session,
and I invite all the panelists
to be on screen
as we field
these questions.
We have several in the Q and A,
and I believe one person
has been invited to speak
or present
his question verbally.
And so that might be
the best opportunity
to go to start there.
If not, I'll go ahead and read
some questions
here in the question
and answer chat box.
-Hi, Doctor.
Dr. Ellenbogen is ready, so
let's go ahead and move to him.
-Very good. Thank you.
-Go ahead, Michael.
-[Audio drop]
-Yeah, regrettably, there's
some audio problems.
-[Audio drop]
-Yeah.
-Yeah, Michael,
we're going mute you,
and you need to toggle
your microphone.
And we're going to go
ahead do Charlie
while you get it sorted out,
and we'll come back to you.
Dr. DeCarli, are you available?
-Yes.
Can you hear me well enough?
-Yeah, of course, Charlie.
Thank you.
-I want to start by saying,
I'm a little bit more optimistic
about how much work
has been done.
At the level of
the epidemiology,
I think that there are members
of this panel
and others who have been leading
incredibly important studies
on diverse populations
and that have resulted
in some really unique findings.
My question for the group is,
how do we take those
epidemiological studies
and dive deeper,
as we have done with
our European white individuals,
to really look at these
important mechanisms
that may differ by life
experience and cultural effects
and possibly
some minor genetic effects?
I think about our own ADRC,
in which we have three different
groups that we look at,
but that's not enough.
You know, we're missing
other groups,
and we need to take the tools
that have been developed
in the European studies
through core resources
and extend them
to our diverse communities
to really start
to understand mechanistic --
mechanisms of dementia,
and I just would like the panel
to speak to how they feel
about that digging deeper
and getting into, you know,
the mechanistic approaches.
-Thank you, Dr. DeCarli.
We great appreciate
your question.
I think I will go ahead
and pass this over
to Dr. Khachaturian,
who has his hand raised,
and I believe
wants to field the...
No, Jennifer.
-I'll start out here.
I think, Charlie, you touch
on this aspect
of the richness and
informativeness of experiences
that we're missing out
when we aim for cohorts to be
proportionately representative
of the US population.
So we miss out on the experience
of traditionally
underrepresented groups,
and so I think that is
one of many justifications
for developing cohorts
that are composed completely of
groups from specific communities
that have traditionally
not been represented,
and that gives us
an opportunity
to look at the range
of those experiences
that you were mentioning,
and I know there's some people
on the panel here
who, in fact,
are the PIs of such cohorts.
So that would be one start
into that,
but I certainly open up
the panel or open up the floor
to others who have suggestions
and thoughts on this.
-Yeah. Dr. Weuve I think
that's something we have been
stressing in this shift
from health disparities
to a focus more
on health equities
and to achieve
such lofty goals,
I think as you mentioned,
looking within the life
course of individual
ethnic racial groups
may be preferred,
if not desirable
and underscoring
this notion of life course
and the midlife perspective
in particular
that seems to be so rich
in terms of finding
new opportunities
or risks and resilience
factors for healthy
or unhealthy
cognitive aging.
And so perspective
cohort studies,
beginning earlier in life,
certainly are of high interest
and seem to be addressing
what you are suggesting
here in your question.
-No, I'm going to interrupt.
I apologize, I'm going to
push back a little.
-Sure.
-When I'm talking about
are studies
where we can follow
these individuals
and get in depth, biologically
meaningful information,
that extend beyond...
the epidemiological studies
are very important,
critically important
to get perspective.
But then we need to dig down,
and that includes,
I mean,
missing from this are --
has been alluded
to serum plasma,
CSF biomarkers,
neuropathological materials.
When you look at
what's out there
in terms of
neuropathological materials,
it's very limited,
and I believe we need to be
moving in that direction,
just as we've done
in other populations,
with European
population.
That's where discovery
occurs, in mechanisms.
-I think we have
several panelists
that are also
wishing to respond.
So...
-Yeah, can I jump in, Hector,
just to quickly...
-Yeah, sure, Lisa, please,
Dr. Barnes.
-Charlie, I think you answered
your own question.
I do believe we need to move
beyond descriptive epidemiology
with these minoritized
populations and understand
some of the barriers to getting
more of the more invasive data,
you know, like the pathology
data, biomarker data.
As you know, we at Rush work
very hard
to get brains
from minoritized populations
and it takes decades of effort
and relationship building,
but that is how
we are going to discover
these underlying mechanisms that
are leading to the disparities,
but also something
that you said,
I don't think we should
just take what we've learned
from the white
homogeneous samples.
I think we have to work
to understand
the unique race
or ethnic relevant factors
in the populations
that we're studying.
And you cannot get that
unless you have people
enrolled in the study,
you build relationships,
and you work to educate them
on why these types of data
are needed.
So thank you for that question.
-Okay, so now we invite
any other speaker to --
or person with a question
to step up.
-Well, Sid and Toni,
do you guys want to answer
that one or can we move on?
-Yes.
I'd just like to say
a couple of things
to reiterate
what Dr. Barnes has said,
and a little bit about
what our group reported on.
When we said we need to address
issues from neurons
to neighborhoods,
and that's what we need.
I mean, it's not
a one-size-fits-all.
It's not a one approach
fits all.
It's we need a combination
of multiple perspectives,
and we need to go wide and deep.
So we need a within
and a between approach.
We need life course
cumulative studies.
We need an accumulation
across studies
that have perhaps
been more width than breadth.
So I just want to say
that we need multiple methods.
We need multiple approaches.
We need multiple samples,
and we need to understand
that good science will help us
across a variety of approaches.
And I think these are words
people will understand.
I just want to bring it forward
in addressing the question
that was raised.
-Thank you, Dr. Antonucci.
Next up, I'd like to invite
Mr. Dr. Michael Ellenbogen
to ask --
try his question again, please.
-Can you hear me?
-Quite well, thank you.
-Great, thank you so much.
First, let me correct you.
I appreciate being upgraded,
but I'm not a doctor.
I'm just a patient
living with dementia.
I would like to thank you all
for what you have done.
I've been a part of these
summits for many years,
and every time
I am at one of these,
you folks always take
my recommendations
and follow through with them.
So I thank you so much
for making all this happen.
I'd like to speak though,
in reference to the health
equity for people with dementia.
And I think that is a very
important subject
because there are
so many places out there,
like the University
of Pennsylvania,
who you folks tend to fund
for various clinical trials.
But some of the problems
we have is, places like that,
believe it or not, charge money
to get into the clinical trial.
Most clinical trials you do not
have to pay money for.
So I think NIH and NIA
needs to find a way
that when you ask
for these folks
to do clinical trials for you,
that you put some kind of
stipulations to make it
so that it's going to be free.
Because if it's not, it's going
to hold up for getting people
who are Hispanics,
African Americans
to get into these
clinical trials.
University of Pennsylvania
happens to be
in a very big minority area,
yet if you look
at the amount of minorities
they have included
in their clinical trials,
you'll see they're not able
to get into them.
I try to get into it and I
wasn't able to get into it
because they wanted
to charge money.
So therefore, I went to
some other place,
and there's many places
to go to.
But most people don't have
the luxury
I have that they can drive
to further places.
So I would hope you folks
consider
how you address
this kind of situations
so more people of minorities
can get into clinical trials,
because to me, I think they're
the most important people to be
in the clinical trials.
-Mr. Ellenbogen, thank you
so much for your comments.
Greatly appreciate hearing
not PhD or MD's perspective,
but the patient perspective
of the patient's journey
through the clinical trials
experiences.
And you're absolutely right,
as you said at the beginning,
your recommendations now
that you just voiced will be
addressed in the final
recommendations that we make.
I don't have a particular
response for you,
but I want you
to rest assured
that we will address your
comment and your recommendation.
Thank you so much.
Moving right along, and again,
thank you for your question.
I believe
Ms. or Dr. Florence Johnson --
how's that? -- will take the
floor or the mic next please.
-Good morning, thank you all
for a great presentation.
I would like to say
to Mr. Ellenburg
that you're not just a patient
living with dementia.
You have a strong voice.
People living with dementia
are definitely teachers for us
and we need to listen
to your life experiences
as we continue
with our research.
I'm a second year student
in the University of Michigan
School of Nursing,
and I -- my focus of research
is on family caregivers.
I would just like some
historical background
on how we got to the term
Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias.
Thank you.
-I will turn this...
I don't see anybody volunteering
to respond to this question,
which I think would be --
so let me give it a shot
and I'll invite others
to step up and respond as well.
How did we come to this term,
Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias?
And that's an excellent question
as a second year
nursing student,
and I certainly wish
you the best
at one of the great institutions
in our country,
the University of Michigan.
Go blue.
Yes, we got thumbs up
from Dr. Antonucci too,
who's a Michigan person here.
So all that said, is that this
started with some seminal work
over 100 years ago about --
from pathology,
from a pathological study
by a man named Alzheimer's.
Now, I'm not going to go into
the full history
of Alzheimer's
and related dementias,
but since then we've come
to recognize
that dementia
has different etiologies.
Alzheimer's disease
is just one etiology,
and I think we need
to keep that in mind
as we look across the field.
There are other etiologies,
and in particular etiologies
that we think may impact
people of color
are vascular dementias
in particular.
You know, you're probably
learning right now
about the high rates
of hypertension, diabetes
and these other terrible,
chronic conditions
that so disproportionately
affect Latino,
Black, African American
and other populations.
We think these are
major contributors
to dementias among dementias,
now I'm saying because
we're going to be agnostic
in terms of the etiology,
dementias that may be drivers.
But we don't know.
We need the data,
as has been mentioned before,
as Dr. Barnes and others
have said we need the data,
we need to move forward
in gathering this data.
But we're kind of feeling
around in the dark,
and until we have the light
of new data, new research,
I think we will --
there's much work to be done.
I see there's other people
wishing to respond
and I'll start
with Dr. Peterson.
-Thanks very much, Hector.
I will take some responsibility
for this term,
going back to the beginning
of the advisory council
for the national plan.
And as was outlined initially,
earlier this morning,
the terminology focused
on Alzheimer's disease,
but clearly the law,
the NAPA activity,
wanted to include the other
major dementic disorders
as well.
And while it's imperfect,
this was the term
that was decided upon to capture
these related disorders.
Now there's a whole nomenclature
initiative
that has been part
of these summits in the past
that is addressing this topic.
But it is a bit confusing,
I will admit that,
because these disorders
may or may not be related
to Alzheimer's disease itself,
but it is sort of
a historical explanation.
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Dr. Peterson.
If you could lower
your hand now, please.
Next up, I'd like to invite
Dale Lestina,
and I'm not going to scribe
any titles or honorifics
to anybody here now,
just please,
Dale Lestina, if you would.
-With some apologies,
we're actually having trouble
getting Dale promoted up.
So the next one is Rene Anand,
I think you're with us here.
-Yeah, hi. Good afternoon.
Thank you, by the way
for this wonderful webinar.
My question related --
it's a three-part question.
It relates to how genetics,
environment and nutrition
interact
to actually get susceptibility
to clinical disease.
Just to disclose,
we make brain organoid models
of Alzheimer's disease,
so we are very advanced
in our studies
and they're very replicable.
What we find, and this is why
I was asking the question is,
orotic Alzheimer's
also genetic origin.
What I'm asking actually,
is all Alzheimer's genetic?
And we find, by making models
of sporadic
Alzheimer's versus
familiar Alzheimer's
that in fact there's
a convergent for data sets,
which leads us to believe --
our samples are small --
leads us to believe
that in fact the genetic risk
that exists at birth
for all Alzheimer's,
however the risk is not
necessarily clinical disease.
There's a gene
and environmental interactions
that occur throughout life,
somewhere along the way,
either at birth
or during childhood
to take that risk
into disease.
And the risk that we are finding
are environmental,
as well as nutritional.
And so I think it's a game
changer
in how we think
about Alzheimer's
because a lot of discussion
about health equity.
And I think we have the ability
to begin to answer
this question,
but however our sample size,
I must admit,
are rather small at this time.
So is there any other evidence
from the other types of studies
that leads us to believe
that what we are seeing
might be correct?
-For this one, I think I will
turn it over to Dr. Fornage.
I was thinking of you, Miriam,
when Dr. Anand presented
his question.
So I'll hand it over to you,
please, Dr. Fornage.
-Yes, so thank you
for the question.
So Alzheimer's disease,
the sporadic form
is indeed genetic,
but it's not fully genetic.
So it's a poster child for
multifactorial disease,
as you mentioned.
It is a combination of genes
and the environment.
And so as geneticists spend
a lot of time looking for genes,
and in fact, we have identified
quite a number of genetic loci
across the genome
in human studies,
including APOE
being the major risk factors --
genetic risk factor.
But others, we have probably
around 40 loci at the moment
for Alzheimer's disease,
and individually this loci don't
contribute much to the risk,
but collectively
they do quite a bit.
And as you mentioned, certainly
the environment is important.
And it's not -- we haven't done
very in depth studies
to look at this gene
environment interaction problem
because this is
a difficult problem
that requires very,
very large sample size
and good measures
of environment.
And so for that,
we still in the infancy
of these types of studies.
But as you mentioned, this is
a very critical area of focus
for us to understand
how genetic behaves
or the genetic risk
to Alzheimer's disease
and dementia is modified
by environment
and environment factors.
So thank you for the question,
I hope that answered it.
-Thank you, Dr. Fornage.
-Yeah, thank you, Myriam.
I just wanted to add --
I think poverty that leads
to the nutritional deficiencies
is in fact one of the drivers.
That's where I'm going
with the question.
And if it's not addressed,
it just shows up
much later in life
in ways that are much harder
to deal with.
But thank you all.
-Thank you very much,
Dr. Anand.
And I think Martine --
Martin had a response
or a question.
Or if it's a question,
I'd just like to follow up
with Dr. Fornage,
what she had to say.
And I am very curious
and interested
in some of the work
that's being done with organoids
and I think it holds
great promise for our science.
My understanding of the organoid
work that's been done
is we have a limited
spectrum of patients
from which organoids
have been derived.
And I think this is something
that Dr. Turoff
and his group had alluded to
is that truly we need to expand
that diversity of people
with dementias
to include people of different
ethnic racial heritages
so that we can understand
if there's any variability
between how those organoids
respond to,
whether it be shotgun approaches
for therapies or what have you.
So I just wanted to follow up
with that comment of my own.
Martin, you had your hand up?
-Hi, yes. Good morning.
I'm a program director at NIA,
but I just wanted
to follow up on a comment
on the importance
of really trying to understand
how the environment
also contributes
and interacts
with the genetics.
This is particularly important
for health equity research,
since most of our
minoritized operations
are often the ones that
are living in an environment
with the worse
environmental exposures.
And so I believe that there is
a lot of room
to do additional work
in this regard
and really understand it
and how we measure
environmental exposures,
how we assess the multiple
sources of exposures
over a life course
and how this relates to the
etiology of the disease overall.
-Thank you very much
for your insights.
Before we get to the next
question, Milan Fiala...
...you had your hand raised.
Well while we're waiting,
I'd like to invite
Patricia Heyn to the mic please.
-Thank you so much
for the opportunity.
This is such a great meeting
and I'm so excited
to see all the developments.
And I just made a suggestion to,
as we plan for the workforce
and for the diversity
and inclusion,
to also think in the support
of research, mentoring,
leadership training
through a life span perspective.
There's so much of work
now in the early career,
in the stages of the very early
development of your profession,
but we as professionals,
we also have a life span
in terms of the different phases
and the different needs.
And I think we also need
to start to think about
how we're going to be developing
our research and portfolio,
that we'll take that
into consideration for us
to avoid to be
age discriminating
or maybe career stage
is in discrimination
because we are not thinking
about this perspective
of career span development
or the different needs,
especially for researchers
that come from underserved
background or minority,
where they're already
going to be
in a position
of less privilege
when they're going to be
starting the development.
And that contribution
does not only come
by evaluating the number
of grants of other ones,
but is also diverse
in terms of the contribution
that professionals can bring to
their field in different sectors
that sometimes is not
by grant awards.
-Thank you for your comments.
I am going to turn this over
to either Dr. Gilsanz or Medina,
who may wish to respond.
But I think yours
is a recommendation
to enhance workforce
development,
not only for the new people
coming into the field,
maybe leaning
towards younger perhaps,
but also across the life span
and also to ensure that
workforce development continues
and is available
throughout the life course.
There are some efforts, but we
certainly will add the --
your recommendation or consider
your recommendation
as we develop --
as we finalize
our recommendations
shown here
on the screen right now.
So thank you very much
for your comments.
I see Milan Fiala has her hand
raised again,
would you please try
your mic this time, take two?
Yeah, you're still muted.
So, okay, go for it.
You just need
to unmute yourself.
-Okay, can you hear me now?
-Yes, I can.
Yes we can, I hope.
-This summit has been
about health equity
and ways to overcome this.
But on the other hand,
in cardiology the progress
has been made by identifying
the common factors
and then showing how each group
deviates from this norm.
And I think our basic research
in neuroimmunology shows
that there are common factors,
a common norm
that should be applied
and then identify
the diversity.
And the diversity lies
in the lifestyle
and especially in the diet,
because the most important thing
is to identify how the brain
is cleared of amyloid beta
and flushed with tau.
Those are the drivers
of the disease.
And we showed that
the immune system in the brain
is what the lymphatics are doing
elsewhere in the body
and there are lymphatic
connections in the brain,
to the meninges that help
the immune system
to clean the brain.
And the problem is that
the immune system does not have
the energy to do its job,
that's one problem.
And the other problem is that
the immune system is inhibited
by accumulation of amyloid
beta in the vessels.
And so, if we can push forward
this way of treating
the disease,
that we needs to have
the right carbohydrate --
complex carbohydrate,
and then we have
the right sources of fats,
energy,
which are plant-based energies,
then we can then identify
how each group
deviates from this norm
and advance changes in the diet
and the lifestyle
and this will help us
to be more effective.
As it is now, the diet is driven
by economic interests,
not by science.
Thank you.
-Thank you for your comments.
I think now we will turn
to the Q and A box.
How's our time?
-Hector, we actually managed
to get Dale Lestina,
so can we go to Dale?
-Oh, please, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
-Oh, no problem.
-Thank you very much.
I have a recommendation
based on being a caregiver.
One can --
there are some cancers
that are curable,
but Alzheimer's, that is not
curable, it just ends in death.
And as a former caregiver,
my wife has now passed on,
the role of a caregiver really,
during this process
is to keep the person
that they're care giving to
as calm and stress free
and comfortable as possible
during the time that they're
going through the journey.
What happens is that when --
at least in my case,
and I know it
in the support groups,
almost without exception
is that the neurologist
that treats this,
and that you go to first
in the process,
won't tell you it's terminal,
will give you a medicine,
and you do get a little better
for it for a while
and then it doesn't
work anymore.
Then you get another medicine,
same kind of result.
I think that to be four-square
and to tell the caregiver
offline if necessary...
-Mr. Lestina, we're firstly,
my condolences to you
for the loss of your wife.
But your audio visual
seems to have frozen,
so regrettably you're unable
to complete
your important thoughts.
Okay, I think we're going to
have to move on,
but certainly, I, again,
want to offer my condolences
on behalf of the panel.
And I think that your comments
as a caregiver are very valuable
and important to the panelists,
and I will certainly --
we will take note of your
comments about disclosure
and being open and candid
and transparent
with the caregivers
about a loved one's condition
and ultimate fate.
So thank you very much
for your comments.
-Well yes.
-Oh, there you are.
-I just --
I don't know what happened.
I didn't touch a thing.
-It was the gremlins again,
but please proceed.
-Okay, well this would be good
to know, right up front if --
that your wife or the person
that you're care giving
is not going to get better
and that what your role is
just to help him or her
along through the process
as stress free as possible,
didn't have that.
And for my view, that's a pretty
common thing,
if it's not pervasive
of the medical profession
not letting a person know where
in the world this is headed.
That is my recommendation.
-Yes, thanks again.
And this is what
the open mic is about,
to solicit your recommendations
as a caregiver,
and I'm very grateful to you
for sharing your experience
but also your recommendation
here in this open forum.
Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.
-You have been heard,
and you will be heard.
[ Chatter ]
-So we're going to extend
for about 4 more minutes
into the break,
but for everyone that's in line
to ask questions, apologies,
just like in the live
version of this,
we're not going to be able
to get to everyone.
We will open up the chat for
everyone during all the breaks.
If you want to ask
your questions
in a less formal way there,
the panelists may or may not
choose to interact there,
but again just like
in the live sessions,
we're not going to be able
to get to everyone.
So we're going to do our best.
The next questioner
is Diane Bovenkamp.
-Thank you, Keith.
Diane Bovenkamp.
-Yeah, so I'm with
BrightFocus Foundation.
We fund research for Alzheimer's
and related to dementia,
glaucoma
and macular degeneration.
So this has been a wonderful
session.
Thank you so much to everyone,
and I'm really excited
about all the recommendations.
So my question for the panel
is when considering
health equity and differences
of underrepresented
and minority communities,
how can we consider
the whole person,
not just the brain but perhaps
crossover mechanisms
with the retina and eye,
right, as well?
So have the committees here
considered
bringing in vision researchers,
maybe the National Eye Institute
when making future plans
for research or trial design,
perhaps collecting eyes
as well as brains at banks?
And so the context of that
is that there are
a lot of biomarkers,
a lot of genes they're finding
like ApoE, APBB2,
right that there are risk genes
in African Americans
different from Caucasians,
and in many cases
there could be inverse effects
that increase the risk
of vision versus ADRD,
and, you know,
also in light of many groups
using the eye to diagnose
dementia, as well, right?
So I guess my question is --
And the other thing
is so perhaps
there could be
unintended consequences
for future treatments
in differing groups,
and so you definitely need to go
the route of personalized
medicine, right?
So my question is just to,
you know,
ask the panel to comment that
and maybe have you considered,
you know, including vision
and maybe the NEI and eye
researchers in the plans?
-Thank you Ms. Bovenkamp,
or Dr. Bovenkamp.
Anyway, I'm going to turn
this over to Dr. O'Bryant,
who quickly responded
with a raised hand,
but before he does,
I do want to say
that our own ADRC is collecting
other nervous tissue,
in particular eye,
and so I think this is
a brilliant recommendation.
I think it's more of
a recommendation instead
of a question
but certainly to gather
additional tissue
that may be useful,
but first we got to get there.
I think that's something
that Dr. Barnes has alluded to
is we do not have the level
of autopsy enrollment
that is parallel or equal
to that among whites,
so I think this is something
that as a panel we need
to bring to the forefront
not only just additional tissue,
but just getting the tissue
in the first place
and engaging communities
to be willing to enroll
in autopsy studies.
That's a major challenge
facing us.
Dr. O'Bryant, sorry to steal
your time there, but you're up.
-That's a great point, Diane,
great question,
and it actually circles back
to one of our initial comments
by Charlie of this isn't...
The eye for example,
is a great way to get
into additional research
because there's research showing
different medical comorbidities
and so the diabetic neuropathy
may be more common
among certain groups
which may predispose
to cognitive dysfunction.
One way I like
to conceptualize this
and think about
is as scientists,
we really bear the responsible
of increasing access
to research methods too.
These advanced methods
of getting at pathology
all within
a sociocultural context
is something that has not
been done enough,
and so we must increase access
to these cutting-edge
technologies
that have been used in research
among non-Hispanic
white populations
since they've been invented,
and so the breadth
of the examinations and methods
that we do
in diverse communities
really has to mirror
that among...
That we've done among
non-Hispanic whites,
and so I view that
as increasing access
even to the research
methods themselves
because we're going
to learn more.
And the research already coming
out among diverse populations
says that many
of these markers change,
so this is of incredible
importance,
and so it's a great comment.
-Dr. Khachaturian,
and thank you Dr. O'Bryant.
-I'll be brief, and thank you,
Diane, for the question.
I mean, and I really think
that this topic
around patient journey
and learning health systems
is going to be something
that we're really now
going to have to focus on,
I mean, certainly the decision
by FDA around aducanumab
certainly opened up
and laid bare
some of the regulatory issues
that we have to deal with
in terms of not just
efficacy decisions of drugs
but also the reimbursement side
of the equation, and I think,
you know, your concepts
and those of many others
looking at sort of
this more holistic question
is really going to have
to figure out
how we're actually going to pay
for these things
and how are we going to help
the general practitioners,
the primary care physicians
be able to manage patients
particularly from these
underserved
and underrepresented communities
more holistically.
And I think it's a great point,
and I think it's really going to
be sort of an exciting 2022
as we talk about that further.
-Thank you, Dr. Khachaturian,
and again thank you, Diane,
for your insightful
recommendation.
I think we had Dr. Whitfield --
as Whitaker has suggested,
we're going to go over 5 minutes
but now I see
we've gone over 7 minutes.
I don't know, I'm going to yield
the floor to Dr. Whitaker
for his guidance
on how to proceed,
but on behalf of the Health
Equities Committee,
thank you to all
for your stepping up to the mic
and also for your comments
in the chat box.
We will be responding to
those online
and as I said before, we will --
are definitely taking your
comments into consideration.
So thank you for providing
your insights.
-Our next scientific session
is dedicated
to frontotemporal degeneration.
And it's my pleasure to
introduce the session
cochairs Drs. Adam Boxer
and Celeste Karch.
Welcome.
-Hi.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Hi, I'm Celeste Karch,
and along with Adam Boxer
we served as cochairs
of this session
to focus on the priorities
for FTD research.
And this has been such
an outstanding group to work
with that has been led
by Thomas Cheever at NINDS
and really represents
outstanding investigators
in academia,
in industry and
from patient advocacy groups.
Next slide.
So in this session,
we're hoping to address
some of the major
accomplishments
that have come as a result
of the 2019 recommendations,
and these were really focused
in two main areas,
clinical science
and basic science
with a focus
on pathogenesis and toxicity,
and with the results that have
come in the intervening years,
we've set a series of eight
major recommendations for 2022,
and you'll hear
about the first three.
Adam, do you want to say those,
or should I jump to the fourth?
-Maybe you can just keep going,
and I'll jump back.
-Great.
So you'll hear in just a bit
from Adam
about recommendations
one through three,
and throughout this session
you'll hear
about how these different
recommendations have emerged
based
on the prior research.
And so in recommendation four,
we are hoping to identify
overlapping
pathogenic mechanisms
between FTD and other
neurodegenerative diseases.
In recommendation five,
we hope to advance
the understanding of FTD
and to identify therapeutic
targets through preclinical
and translational tools
and resources.
And in recommendation six to
accelerate preclinical disease
modifying and somatic
therapeutic development.
And in recommendation seven
to elucidate
the mechanisms of cell
type vulnerability
both cell intrinsic
and cell extrinsic.
And finally in recommendation
eight to define the genetic
and molecular modifiers of FTD
with a special emphasis
on including diverse populations
in these efforts.
-Great.
Well, thank you, Celeste,
and also wanted
to thank the committee
and I'm going to be
the first speaker,
and I am going to focus
on recommendations
one through three.
And just wanted to highlight
that these recommendations
really are an evolution of some
of the recommendations in 2019,
and we've made
really good progress,
we think,
and so recommendation
one is to understand
FTD epidemiology
genetics in diverse populations.
Our recommendation two is
to develop
an array of FTD biomarkers
for diagnosis, prediction
and disease monitoring.
Recommendation three is
to accelerate
the evaluation of novel
FTD treatments
by developing new
clinical trial resources
and FTD-specific designs
and by conducting new trials,
and then I'll highlight
some things
that also influence
recommendation
eight which is defining genetic
and molecular modifiers of FTD.
Next slide, please.
Here are my disclosures.
There are quite a number
to go through.
So we'll just skip this.
Next.
So first I wanted to highlight
some of the progress that we,
as the FTD research community,
have made since
the 2019 recommendations,
and one is the initiation
of a large clinical research
network called ALLFTD
which was the continuation of
two previously funded projects
called ARTFL and LEFFTDS.
This began in 2019,
and unfortunately
we were heavily
impacted by the COVID pandemic,
but we were able to initiate
23 centers, and next, please.
This project enrolls
both individuals
with genetic forms of FTD
and about 40 percent
of individuals
have a strong family history
as well as sporadic individuals
who do not have a clear genetic
or family history of FTD,
and you can see
the different genetic cohorts
that we have as well
as the main sporadic cohorts,
and there are about
1,000 in each, next.
And this is...
This ALLFTD network
has really allowed for multiple
other research projects
to be funded and built
and this is
a nice infrastructure
on which we can also work
with our patient
advocacy group partners
including the FTD
Disorders Registry
and the Bluefield Project
which sponsors a project
to further develop
a plasma neurofilament light
as a biomarker
through the neurofilament
light surveillance project
as well as increasingly this
is serving to promote
clinical trials.
Next slide.
So these are some of the studies
that have either been published
or will be published soon
from the ALLFTD network.
One is to show...
Many of them are focusing
on blood biomarkers
which has really been a focus,
and you can see that
neurofilament light chain
is a good predictor
of disease progression
in genetic forms of FTD
on the left
and on the right
is also very elevated
in sporadic forms of FTD,
and so maybe a good biomarker
for both groups.
Next.
We've also put quite a bit
of effort into biomarkers
that can differentiate
sporadic forms of FTD
from Alzheimer's disease
because clinically these are
difficult diseases
to differentiate,
and here you can see that plasma
phosphorylated forms of tau
are really very useful
at differentiating
Alzheimer's disease
from different
FTD neuropathologies
and really quite accurate.
We think this is going
to help clinicians
to more accurately
diagnose FTD
but also to enable new
clinical trials of sporadic FTD.
We've also learned quite
a bit about risk factors
and potential interventions
that might help individuals
both with genetic
and sporadic forms of FTD.
And so on the left you can see
that in mutation carriers,
that there is now
increasing evidence
that both physical activity
and cognitive activity
are associated with slower rates
of disease progression
and less brain atrophy
over time,
and we think that this may also
apply to sporadic forms of FTD.
Next.
And we've been trying
to harmonize
the genetic
and sporadic FTD studies,
and here is an example
showing that brain atrophy
in genetic forms of FTD
is very similar
to what you see in sporadic FTD,
and this gives us confidence
that what we learn
from the genetic forms of FTD
can be applied to sporadic FTD
and hopefully vice verse.
Next slide.
So one of the exciting
developments,
and this is a study
that's funded by the NIH
and the Alzheimer's Association,
is through the ALLFTD network
we can now start to think about
putting together novel clinical
trials for our patients with,
in this case sporadic FTD,
and this is for semantic variant
primary progressive aphasia,
and you can see in the images
and on the left side
of the slide
that in this form
of primary progressive aphasia
there is very strong evidence
that inflammation in the brain
plays a big role.
So there's a PET scan and color
picture on the left
showing inflammation
in the left temporal lobe,
and this correlates with where
we see damage by brain atrophy,
and this is from
one of our sites
in the ALLFTD
network in Houston.
And so we think
that the inflammation
promotes TDP 43 pathology,
and we will be soon
testing a new drug,
a myeloperoxidase inhibitor
that we hope can block
this inflammation in microglia,
and we hope will slow
the progression
of primary progressive
aphasia or semantic variant PPA.
So very excited about this.
Next slide.
But we've also learned,
and I think there were
comments earlier,
that FTD is a very rare disease,
and it's going to take a global
effort to really prevent FTD
and to possibly understand it,
and so in collaboration with
our colleagues around the world
we formed a new organization
called the FTD Prevention
Initiative, and next, please.
This started as a collaboration
between ALLFTD
and the genetic FTD initiative
in Europe and Canada
and the UK led by
our colleague John Rohrer,
and next, we're now...
And this was supported initially
by our patient advocacy
group partners, the AFTD
and the Bluefield project
and the FTD
Disorders Registry.
Next.
We're now working to incorporate
other FTD research
networks around the world,
so the ReDLat study
funded by the NIH
led by Augustine Ibanez
in South America
and the DINAD and FTDGen studies
in Australia and New Zealand,
next, as well as networks
throughout Asia
that we're starting
to form links with,
and the goal is to share data
to really understand FTD
in diverse populations
but to plan global FTD
prevention trials as well.
Next.
So here I want to show you
an example
of one of the
collaborative studies
that has come out
of this global network,
and this is data
in FTD mutation carriers
with the three most common FTD
causing mutations
C9 open reading frame
for granulin
and tau on the three panels
at the top,
and this is data from combined
across the USA, Canada,
Europe and the UK,
and what you can see is that
we can start to harmonize
the different clinical measures,
MRI biomarkers
and blood neurofilament levels
to understand what the earliest
signs of disease
are prior to the onset
of symptoms
which is on the X axis
indicated by a zero.
And hopefully what
you can appreciate
is that due
to the different mutations
there are slightly
different patterns
of presymptomatic changes.
On the left in C9 open
reading frame mutation carriers,
you see very early MRI changes,
whereas in tau mutation
carriers on the right,
we see a later rise
in purple of neurofilament.
Next.
-A few minutes remaining.
-Yep, next.
And so these are the raw data
on which they're based,
and you can see
these are harmonized
across the different networks.
Next.
And what we're learning
from looking at all these data
is that there are bits of noise
you can see prior
to the onset of symptoms
that means that really
what we need are new biomarkers
to detect and measure disease in
the early presymptomatic stage,
and so this needs to be
a focus of our future research.
Next.
And so the new recommendations
really are focused --
come out of these challenges
in various FTD research.
Next.
So first is just --
one back, but this is fine --
lack of diversity, and really
everything that we know is
from data in non-Latin
white individuals,
and despite a lot of efforts
we haven't been very successful
in including people
from diverse populations
in FTD studies around the world,
and this needs to be a focus
because we're learning
that the genetics of FTD
are different
in different populations.
So this is not just a diversity,
equity and inclusion issue
but also a scientific flaw
in our previous work.
We've heard that FTD diseases
are rare diseases,
and so to do large
clinical trials
we're going to need
a global effort.
Next.
And as I mentioned,
we have some biomarkers,
but we need much more
particularly for sporadic
diseases where late diagnosis
is a real problem
for testing therapies.
Next.
And then we've learned from
COVID that in all these rare
and geographically
dispersed populations,
it's very hard for people
particularly from
underrepresented populations
to travel
to research centers,
and so we need to think
about remote assessment tools,
particularly biomarkers
that we can deploy
even in third-world countries
where PET scans or MRI
may not be available.
Next.
And so I'm just going to end
that these are the priorities
that I hopefully
talked to you a bit about
and that really you'll hear
much more about it
throughout the future talks,
and I want to thank you
for your attention
and now introduce
the next speakers
who are Anthony Fitzpatrick
and Leonard Petrucelli.
-Thanks very much, Adam.
My name is Anthony Fitzpatrick
from Columbia University
in New York,
and today Leonard Petrucelli
and I from Mayo Clinic Florida
will be talking about
recently published work
that we've been doing on FTD.
Next slide, please.
So we have nothing to disclose.
Next slide, please.
So my lab primarily is using
a very powerful
microscopy technique
known as
cyro-electron microscopy
to actually study
at the atomic level
those protein tangles associated
with many different
neurodegenerative diseases.
This started in 2017
whenever we solved
the first structure
of tau filaments
from Alzheimer's disease
shown here on the right,
and over the last few years
we've been systematically
going through other diseases
such as progressive
supranuclear palsy
and also CBD and solving
their structures
at the neuro-atomic level,
so that we can understand
better what the differences
are between
the molecular signatures
of each of these
terrible diseases.
And what we're finding is
that each different tauopathy
has a unique
molecular signature.
So you can see that these
cross sections
which we're showing here in the
figure look quite different,
and if we go to
the next slide, please.
And as a result of that,
we can actually begin
to understand better
not only what the differences
are at a molecular level
between tau filaments in each of
these different diseases
but also how we can better
design biomarkers
that bind to each of these tau
filaments in different diseases.
So what we've shown here is
a kind of cartoon representation
of the molecules,
and you can see that
there's a big difference
between the accessible regions
of the tau molecule.
So we consider them broken down
into what we call microtubule
binding repeats
so R1, 2, 3 and 4,
and looking at those
different colors you can see
that the actual cross sections
across these different diseases
are incredibly different.
So even between CBD and PSP
which are two very closely,
very difficult
to distinguish tauopathies,
you can actually see
that there's a great deal
of difference in terms of
where you could bind,
say small molecules
or antibodies.
Next slide, please.
I think one of the very exciting
findings that we just made
and just published
in "Cell" a month ago
is the finding that basically
we were looking along
with Ian MacKenzie at University
of British Columbia
and tissue also from
Dennis Dixon at Mayo Clinic,
Florida the sort of range
of filaments
that you find in FTLD TDP,
and so we looked at a range
of different FTLD TDP subtypes,
A, B and C,
and we found surprisingly
that there was
a common filament
that we were finding
in each of these different cases
that were
phenotypically different
and also pathologically
distinct,
and what was surprising
was we also found
the same filament in PSP
along with tau filaments
and also in dementia
with Lewy bodies.
And with the unique
resolving power of cryo-EM,
we were actually able
to identify
what these filaments
were composed of
because we can actually image
right down to the individual
building blocks
of the filaments themselves.
Next slide, please.
So it turned out that actually
these filaments
are all composed
of a protein
that we previously did
not know much about,
TMEM106B which has been known
since 2012 to be a risk factor
for aging and FTLD TDP,
but the protein itself was
thought to have an end terminus
which is associated with
trafficking of lysosomes
and endosomes but not much
was known about the C terminus,
and it turns out that this
luminal C terminal fragment
is extremely aggregation prone
and when it gets cleaved
can actually go on
to form these filaments
that we find.
Next slide, please.
So I think the really
exciting thing about cryo-EM
in this regard
is that it can actually identify
uniquely the actual molecular
constituent and shape
and form of the molecules
forming these filaments,
and we really did not expect
to find something
other than TDP-43 or tau
in these diseases,
and we've now found
a new fibrillization factor
and pathway entirely
from just imaging
postmortem human brain tissue.
And as you can see here, this is
the highest resolution map
that we have at 2.7 angstrom,
and not only can you see
the individual amino acids
that build up this filament
and the shape
and form of the filament,
but you can also see the
post-translation modifications.
We have a lot of glycosylations.
We can also see
the disease-associated T185 site
which we think
is also phosphorylated,
and so this begins
to tell you more
about the biology of why
these filaments are forming
and what
their possible impact could be.
Next slide, please.
So it's early days, this was
an unexpected finding
but given that the TMEM106B
is a lysosomal,
endosomal protein we feel like
whenever it gets cleaved
and forms these fibrils,
this may be associated
with additional lysosomal stress
and given that the lysosome
is a mechanism
by which other filaments form
by say tau
or TDP-43 get degraded,
it could be that this
fibrillization of TMEM106B
is actually causing
additional problems
in terms of getting rid
of those filaments,
and this could in fact
be leading to wider accumulation
of more disease-
associated filaments
such as TDP tau or synuclein.
And I think with that,
I'll hand over to Len
who will then talk
about his recent work.
Thank you.
-Thank you, Anthony.
Next slide, please.
So as Dr. Walter Koroshetz
mentioned in the beginning,
really a lot of the field
has focused their understanding
on delving into the biologic
mechanism with the intent
that this will lead to improved
and identification of novel
therapeutic targets
as well as novel biomarkers,
and so this is work that,
in collaboration
with Dr. Aaron Gitler
from Stanford University
as well as my team
at Mayo Clinic.
In addition there was a paper
also with our colleagues
from Dr. Michael Ward from NIH
and Dr. Pietro Fratta from UCL.
Next slide.
And what this paper
fundamentally describes
is a novel
TDP-43 RNA target.
TDP-43 normally is
within the nucleus
where it regulates
many DNA and RNA events,
and as a result of its
mislocalization to the cytoplasm
there is an apparent
loss of function.
So work from Dr. Eddy Lee
from UPenn
took the first approach which
really enabled these studies,
and that was to fact sort,
to fundamentally separate nuclei
based on the nuclear levels
of TDP-43,
and when we mined that data
looking for potential
alterations in particular
with cryptic exon events
we noticed
that there were
numerous targets,
but one target as denoted
in red really stood out.
Next slide, please.
And the reason why
that it stood out
was because of the fact
that prior work
had really focused on this gene
called UNC13A,
a very important
protein that's involved
in synaptic
neurotransmission release,
pinpointed that it was a risk
factor for ALS and FTD/ALS,
and so it really highlighted
the importance
that perhaps RNA -- excuse me,
that TDP-43 was involved
in the regulation of UNC13A.
Next slide.
And so through a series of...
-Two minutes remaining.
-...through a series
of cell culture experiments,
which are not shown here
but really highlighting
the human postmortem studies
in collaboration
with Dr. Dennis Dickson
at Mayo Clinic,
we show that this abnormal
cryptic exon splicing event
is significantly elevated
in FTD TDP-43,
as you can see in the tissues,
which correlate with the amount
of Phospho-TDP-43 burden.
Next slide.
And so as we heard
from Dr. Boxer as well as,
you know,
from our previous speakers,
really the need for
TDP-43 biomarkers...
This is just
a typical case report
that my colleagues
in neurology will see,
and fundamentally
it's hard to diagnose
whether or not they have
FTD TDP-43 or an FTD tau.
Next slide.
So our approach is to work
towards this capitalizing
on the TDP-43 function
in collaboration
with Dr. Michael Ward,
the intraneural program,
and Dr. Andy Qi.
We've fostered a collaboration
to really pursue this
from a proteomic
and amino-based assay.
Next slide.
And so we wanted to harness
the cryptic splicing events
whereby we would be able
to either generate RNA
or peptide biomarker
candidates.
Next slide.
And as you can see here,
in the left,
an ideal biomarker is one
in which the cryptic exon event
is actually occurring
within the protein itself,
generating a novel
fusion protein.
Other nonideal biomarkers
such as actually UNC13A
from a protein perspective
or Stathmin-2
would be less ideal
because of the fact
that they have
premature termination codon
or premature poly(A).
So I'm just going to give you
one such example
of an RNA target,
next slide,
that really captures our efforts
from a proteomic-based approach,
and this just validates a novel
RNA target called MYO18A,
and you can see that
it's significantly elevated,
this abnormal
splicing event,
in iPS neurons
as well as in human brain,
but using an antibody
against that novel epitope,
we were able to identify
this protein
in the iPSCs in which TDP-43
has been knocked down.
So this is just, you know,
one --
somewhat of a textbook example,
if you will, in which, you know,
we are confident that if we can
take a look at TDP-43 targets,
and there's many of them,
as I had showed you,
that we might be able
to identify a marker
or a surrogate marker
of TDP-43 biological activity
with the intent
that we can discriminate
FTD tau versus FTD TDP-43,
and certainly the implications
are clear for ALS.
And with that, I'll stop
and turn it over
to Drs. Boxer and Karch.
-Okay, thank you.
So my name is Celeste Karch,
again,
and I'm at Washington University
in St. Louis,
and here I'll be sharing
some of our advances
and next steps
for using genetics
to understand
the biology of disease,
and this really builds off
of some of the successes
from the 2019 milestones
and has led
to the identification
of some new
recommendations for 2022.
Next slide.
I've no disclosures.
Next slide.
So ultimately we know
that in FTD
as well as with other
neurodegenerative diseases,
the genetic architecture
is quite complex,
and there's an additional level
of complexity for FTD genetics
given that FTD
has many subtypes,
but what we know is that
the exceedingly rare variants
shown in the upper --
top upper panel on the left,
such as variants in MAPT,
in granulin, in VCP expansions
in C9orf72
and a number of other genes,
that carrying these variants
is really sufficient
to cause disease,
and these are typically
termed pathogenic mutations,
and understanding
the mechanism
by which these genes
and variants lead to disease,
cause disease is really
central to understanding
those events that are central
to disease mechanisms,
and ultimately these genes,
their resulting protein products
can be used as biomarkers
and even targeted
therapeutically with antisense
oligos and other mechanisms.
But even beyond
the pathogenic mutations,
there's still a lot we can learn
from sporadic populations
because really
these rare variants
that confer risk and resilience
for disease and common variants
can tell us a lot about
how we can manipulate the system
to support or protect
against disease,
and so some of these variants
have been identified
in genome-wide
association studies
and in other rare variant
sequencing studies and --
but ultimately,
while we know some about
the genetic architecture of FTD,
there remains a lot
that has been --
remains unexplained,
and this is particularly the
case among diverse populations,
and so that's a major goal
of our recommendations in 2022,
is to expand these efforts.
But beyond understanding
the contribution
of rare variants to disease,
we can also leverage existing
and emerging
antemortem biomarkers
in order to understand
how variants across the genome
may impact these analytes.
This can be a really
powerful approach
for understanding
additional cells
and gene mechanisms that may be
contributing to disease
and that could be monitored
in therapeutic trials
and address
in biologic assays,
and additionally,
one goal for 2022,
which has also been highlighted
by Dr. Boxer, is that while --
one really
interesting example in FTD
are these rare variants
in the MAPT gene that confer --
that lead to one form
of disease, FTD,
but beyond these very rare
mutations that cause disease,
we also know that there's
a number of common variants,
and you can see this
in the lower right panel,
common variants in the MAPT gene
that confer risk
for a number
of different diseases,
including FTD, PSP, CBD,
and even Parkinson's disease,
but this region remains
very poorly understood,
and so additional efforts
to resolve this genetic region
and to understand
the biologic impact is critical.
Next set, next slide.
So here I'm going to highlight
some of the outstanding progress
that's been made
to resolve the function
and to develop biomarkers
for using pathogenic mutations,
risk factors
and protective variants.
This is just a snapshot,
and we're leaving out
a number of incredible studies,
but one really exciting finding
was that VCP,
which is known to be mutated
and cause FTD, is --
has been reported to actually
act as a tau disaggregase,
so it can interfere
with and block
the aggregation of soluble tau
into fibril --
tau fibrils and aggregates,
and so this finding
is really central
to understanding
the function of VCP,
to understand the impact
of a mutation
that may block
this disaggregase function
and promote aggregation,
as well as to set up
potential new avenues
for efforts
in other diseases
where the tau protein
aggregates.
Additionally,
in the last few years,
there's been huge progress
made
in our understanding
of the expansion of C9orf72
and how these expansions
can lead to loss of function
of the C9orf72 protein
and gain of toxic function,
and these efforts have resolved
a lot of the biology
underlining --
underlying the function and
dysfunction of these expansions
but, really importantly,
has also led
to new opportunities
in the development of biomarkers
to monitor some of these DPRs
and also to consider
therapeutic approaches
that target
these mechanisms.
Next slide, please.
We just heard about UNC13A,
and this is a risk variant
that's been identified in ALS
and FTD, and importantly,
the new findings
in these parallel studies,
that were just published
in "Nature,"
really highlight
and place UNC13A in the --
right in the center
of TDP-43 biology,
and so not only does this
tell us about individuals
that carry these variants
but also provides
additional mechanisms
that we can apply
to TDP-43 proteinopathies.
Next slide.
-Two minutes remaining.
-So we can learn a lot from
these rare pathogenic mutations
and common risk factors,
but we can also learn a lot
from these protective variants,
where we can sort of leverage
the biology of the system
that's actually
promoting protection,
and TMEM106B, which you
just heard about, was --
rare variants
were actually originally --
or variants were
originally identified
in genome-wide association
studies of FTD,
and in fact
it was found that,
if you carried the minor allele
of a variant in TMEM106B,
that carrying that allele
while also carrying a causative
mutation in progranulin
extended survival.
And so in fact, TMEM106B
represents
this very interesting molecule
that both may confer
protection as well
as what you heard previously
may play a role in pathogenesis,
and huge efforts have gone on to
demonstrate a role of TMEM106B
in lysosomal function
and in trafficking
of lysosomes through axons
and both to highlight
the impact of TMEM106B
in neurons
as well as glia.
Next slide, please.
But ultimately I think
we've had a lot of success
in not only understanding
individual variants in genes
and their functions
in the cell
but to use high
throughput genomics
to identify additional
pathways in genes
and networks that we can
target therapeutically,
and one example from 2019
looked at mouse
and human tissue from FTD
caused by tau mutations
and FTD caused by
progranulin mutations
and identified a number
of common genes
that were dysregulated,
and among these genes
were a number of microRNAs,
and using
computational techniques,
it was identified that there was
a small molecule
that in fact targeted and
modified a number of the genes
and microRNAs that were
identified to be dysregulated.
These could be then taken
into cell in mouse models
to understand the effectiveness
of these molecules and pathways,
and more recently
there's been outstanding work
showing essentially a map of tau
interactomes in human neurons,
and using a PAX2
in human-induced pluripotent
stem cells,
it's been shown that tau in fact
interacts with a number
of mitochondrial proteins,
and in the context of mutations
in tau that cause FTD,
these interactions
are disrupted.
So these findings using
unbiased approaches
have really highlighted
a potential role
of bioenergetics in tauopathies
and FTD tauopathies that
can be further investigated.
Next slide, please.
-Your time has expired.
-And so just with
this remaining,
we've seen great progress
in organoids
that are derived from induced
pluripotent stem cells
that model disease-relevant
phenotypes
including phospho-tau, autophagy
and glutamatergic loss
that could be further rescued
upon treatment
with drugs such as apilimod.
And final.
And all of this has really
highlighted the need
for stem cell models
and somatic cell models
that are genetically defined
as well as
from sporadic individuals,
and moving forward,
additional efforts
are needed to build
more diverse biorepositories
and to leverage these lines
to understand therapeutics,
to understand disease mechanism
and build therapeutics.
So final slide.
So just briefly to end here,
this all highlights work
that has led
to our 2022 recommendations
to understand FTD genetics
in diverse populations,
to understand overlapping
pathogenic mechanisms
and to better elucidate
the mechanisms
of cell type vulnerability
and to further dissect
and extend these genetic
and molecular modifiers of FTD.
So I apologize for going over,
and I'll next turn it over
to Dr. Frost.
-Thank you, Dr. Karch.
So I'm Bess Frost.
I'm at the University of Texas
Health in San Antonio
and the Biggs Institute ADRC,
and I'll be going over
some real successes
since 2019 that are relevant
to milestones one and two
and that provide rationale
for recommendations
number four through seven
about the basic science
of frontotemporal dementia.
Next slide.
I do serve as a consultant
for the Neurodegeneration
Consortium at MD Anderson,
and I have a sponsored
research agreement with them
as well as with
Transposon Therapeutics.
Next slide.
So I'll first focus
on milestone one,
which was really focused
on trying to understand
the shared mechanisms of disease
among different proteins
that are known to accumulate
in frontotemporal dementias.
So tau, TDP-43 and dipeptide
repeats
originating from C9orf72
expansions
are some of the proteins
that accumulate in
frontotemporal dementia.
This is not comprehensive,
but I felt that
the most progress
in terms of shared mechanisms
have come out of work
focusing on these three
different aspects of FTD.
Next slide.
We have really gained
a greater understanding
of how these proteins affect
overall nuclear architecture
and what's going on
in the nucleus,
and importantly, these studies
have ranged from,
you know, flies to iPSC cultures
to analyzing human brain tissue.
Next slide.
For example, we see in the
context of tauopathies
that there are invaginations
of the nucleus
deep into the nucleoplasm.
This also occurs in the context
of TDP-43 toxicity
and in some models but not
all of C9orf72 expansions.
In the context of these
proteins, nuclear pore proteins
have been shown to be depleted
in some contexts
and even pulled out
of the nucleus
and accumulate
in the cytoplasm.
Nucleocytoplasmic transport
deficits have been reported
in the contexts
of all of these proteins.
These affect how RNA is
trafficked out of the nucleus.
For example, in the context
of tauopathy,
we see that RNA accumulates
within these
nuclear envelope invaginations
as well as how proteins
are trafficked in
and out of the nucleus.
Next slide.
We've also seen quite a bit
of work
suggesting that all of these
factors disrupt
heterochromatin-mediated
gene silencing,
so the overall structure of how
DNA is localized in the nucleus,
and the specific type
of epigenetic changes
that are being seen are a loss
of heterochromatin-mediated
gene silencing.
Next slide.
So we see that tau, TDP-43
and in the context of C9orf72
expansions that heterochromatin
protein 1,
which is really important for
maintaining a tight packaging
of DNA near the centromere,
is becoming disrupted,
and when this protein
becomes disrupted,
you see increased
expression, transcription
of repetitive elements that are
located near the centromere.
Next slide.
One of the types of elements
that is silenced by this really,
really condensed type of DNA
are the transposable elements.
So these transposable elements
make up 45 percent
of the human genome.
They're very similar to --
They're very similar in sequence
to exogenous viruses,
and it's thought
that these elements
got stuck
in the human genome
due to infection
of the germ line,
you know,
over the course of evolution,
and our cells
have developed strategies,
one of which is silencing
by heterochromatin,
to keep these elements
silenced.
However, in the context
of all of these types
of frontotemporal dementia...
Next slide --
we see that these
transposable elements
are becoming activated,
and in fact,
the basic mechanistic studies
in the context of tau
and C9orf have led
to two clinical trials
that are currently ongoing
for the treatment
of Alzheimer's disease
that are leveraging
antiretroviral therapies
to stop transposable
element activation
and suppress
neurodegeneration.
There are also currently trials
enrolling for PSP and ALS/FTD
associated with
C9orf72 expansion.
Next slide.
We also --
There's a lot of accumulating
work from many different groups
about the effects
of these proteins
on splicing
and RNA metabolism.
You heard from Dr. Petrucelli
and Dr. Karch
about links between TDP --
effects of TDP-43 on splicing.
I have to include FUS in here
as well
because FUS is a well-known
regulator of RNA splicing.
Next slide.
So these proteins have either
been shown
to interact directly
with the spliceosome
or to affect
spliceosome function.
We see splicing aberrations
in all of these contexts.
For example, in the context
of tau pathology,
there's an increase
in intron retention.
We heard about cryptic
exon inclusion in TDP-43,
et cetera,
and there's
accumulating evidence
that the overall quality of RNA
is compromised in the context
of these -- this type of front--
these types
of frontotemporal dementia.
Next slide.
-Two minutes remaining.
-New work reports that tau
and C9orf72
are associated with senescence.
So this is a cellular phenotype,
where if the cell is
replicative,
it stops replicating,
and it starts to secrete
inflammatory factors
that are detrimental
for the cells next to it.
In the context of tauopathy,
we now know that --
or there is evidence supporting
senescence in neurons,
which oppose mitotic --
most of which oppose mitotic,
the vasculature
and in astrocytes,
and this work has led
to two clinical trials
now using senolytics for the
purpose of Alzheimer's disease,
where these drugs
are killing the senescent cells.
And I realize
that Alzheimer's disease
is not frontotemporal dementia,
but because these mechanisms
are tau-based,
it's possible that
if we see success
in the Alzheimer's
disease area,
these trials could also be
relevant for FTD tauopathies
and C9orf72 expansions,
which is already enrolling.
Next slide.
So for milestone two,
this is focused on aggregation
from 2019, aggregation
and intercellular
spread of FTD-associated
proteins.
There's new work
in the tau area,
really nice work
from Judith Steen
using her
FLEXITau technology,
really creating a barcode
of tau phosphorylation,
acetylation, ubiquitination
and methylation events
that are associated
with tau aggregation.
Next slide.
In terms of tau spread,
we know now that LRP1
is a major regulator
of cell-to-cell tau spread.
We know that microglia
are important cell types
that facilitate the spread
of tau between cells,
and we now know
that viral capsid proteins
may be also facilitating
the spread of tau between cells.
Next slide.
TDP-43, great work
from the past few years shows
that S-nitrosylation is
important for TDP-43 aggregation
and spread.
Next slide.
So based on all of these
successes since 2019,
we thought it was important to
leverage what's really working
and continue doing that
for the future,
so recommendations four,
five, six
and seven are all relevant
to what I spoke about today,
and you can read more about them
in the meeting materials.
Thank you.
-All right.
Thank you, Dr. Frost.
So I'm Richard Tsai.
I'm a Senior Medical Director
at Denali Therapeutics,
and I've been asked to sort of
give a overview
of clinical trials in FTD
and all the advances recently
but also give a perspective
from the industry side
on developing therapeutics
for FTD
and, most of all,
talk about what reflect
2022 recommendations
one through three.
Next slide.
These are the disclaimers
and disclosures,
and go ahead, next slide.
Okay, so the speakers
before me
have really illustrated a lot of
the advancements in FTD,
whether it's genetics,
tau structure,
protein homeostasis,
cell senescence,
and really the advancements
in these areas
have really resulted
in an explosion
of clinical trials in FTD,
and really it's such an exciting
time to be in this field.
If you see on the right there,
this is derived from a recent
"Lancet Neurology"
review article.
There's a lot of clinical
trials,
most of them thought to be
disease-modifying therapy,
especially in FTD caused by
the granulin gene mutation
or the C9 mutation
as well,
but what I want
to point out here
is that despite the improved
availability of clinical trials,
more has to be done,
especially if you look here.
Not a lot is being done in
MAPT mutation or sporadic FTD,
and really, if you pay
a little more close attention,
you know, the trials
currently available
for MAPT mutation
and sporadic FTD
are actually all
investigator-initiated trials,
which really emphasizes
sort of the importance
of NIH-funded,
academia-started,
investigator-initiated
clinical trials
and maybe a reflection
on some of the novel
and risk-taking
measures available
through that mechanism.
And finally, also, these are all
pharmacological clinical trials,
and as I said, most of them are
thought to be disease-modifying,
but we really shouldn't forget
the importance of drugs
that could offer symptomatic
benefits to clinical trials,
as well as
nonpharmacological interventions
that are not listed here.
Next slide, please.
So first, I just want to go over
how really academic consortiums,
such as ALLFTD that Adam Boxer
mentioned earlier or GENFI
over in Canada
and parts of Europe,
have really enabled
drug development.
These international cohorts
with longitudinal clinical data,
biomarker collection
and infrastructure
have really enabled drug
development and trial design.
So what's maybe not
super obvious here
is you see both consortiums
have identified
and are following
a lot of patients,
collecting a lot of data,
but what's not so obvious here
is that also they have --
they're working with sites
across the U.S.
and Europe and Canada,
and that's also really important
for drug development
and clinical trial design
because this enables
industry folks, like us,
to really have
sort of a first...
Not firsthand but a ready
knowledge of which sites
have the physicians and staff
and infrastructure
that is already
sort of known
to be able to handle
a clinical trial for FTD.
Next slide, please.
So I want to give a case example
of how all of this effort
in the past 3 years
have really helped
developing drugs for FTD,
and this is the case
example for FTD
caused by the granulin
gene mutation,
which we all know results
in haploinsufficiency,
30 to 50 percent of progranulin
in the CSF peripheral blood,
which we think, you know, is...
Progranulin is critical
for lysosomal function,
so it may lead
to lysosomal dysfunction
and may ultimately lead
to inflammation, microgliosis,
TDP-43 pathology
and neurodegeneration,
as illustrated
by the highly elevated
NF-L there in the CS set.
So in this case study, you know,
we thought
that we would give --
solve this problem
by giving back progranulin
using a brain penetrant
progranulin technology.
Next slide, please.
But does this really work?
So next slide.
What we were able to do
in collaboration with ALLFTD
is to really use the large
amounts of clinical data
as well as biofluid samples
in a collaborative study,
and we used it to identify
a series of abnormal biomarkers
in patients with FTD caused by
the granulin gene mutation
that really sort of reflects
the pathophysiology hypothesis
of lysosomal dysfunction,
inflammation, gliosis
and neurodegeneration.
So here you can see on the top
row data from ALLFTD,
patients with the granulin
gene mutation
on the right,
orange and dark red,
and you can see
that asymptomatic carriers
have elevated
glucosylsphingosine
or lysosomal biomarker,
and patients in dark red
are symptomatic FTD
with a granulin gene mutation
but even higher
elevated glucosylsphingosine,
and they also have
elevated YKL-40
or biomarker
of astrogliosis
and, of course,
highly elevated NF-L
when they become
symptomatic.
So that sort of reflects
the pathophysiology hypothesis,
but what's nice is that
we were able to find
the same abnormal biomarkers
in granulin knockout mouse
and treat them
with this drug,
this brain penetrant
progranulin,
and we see a near
dose-responsive
improvement or correction
of these same biomarkers
that are abnormal in patients
that are also abnormal in mouse,
so, you know, improvements
in glucosylsphingosine,
improvements in YKL-40
and also improvements in NF-L.
So this really helped accelerate
a preclinical proof of concept
for drug developers like us
in order to bring the drug
into the clinic,
and I'll further add
that all this clinical data
obtained from ALLFTD and GENFI
has really helped drug companies
sort of determine the right size
and duration of clinical trials
to accurately...
So that we can have
more confidence that we'll see
the effect size in
these biomarkers that we want.
Next slide, please.
-Two minutes remaining.
-Oh, that was quick.
Okay, so I just want to quickly
go over
some of the challenges
we're facing.
I think sample size
estimated at FTD
you'll need about 200 patients
in the pivotal trial
to gain a clinical
meaningful effect.
And on the right there,
we see that, you know,
as a case study
for FTD progranulin,
just back-of-the-envelope
calculation
after taking the prevalence
and estimates
for the number
of Americans we...
That's just maybe
400 trial-ready patients,
meaning patients
with a mutation,
right stage
of disease severity,
not just severe
and also not asymptomatic.
And so, you know, there may not
be enough patients
to support multiple
investigational efforts for FTD,
especially for male FTD.
So to solve this,
we either enhance
the availability of patients
or improve clinical
trial efficiency.
So next slide, please.
One way, of course,
as many people understand,
is to gain better understanding
of underrepresented
diverse populations in FTD.
And on the left here,
you can see that we know
quite a bit about FTD
in North America and Europe,
but very little
in South America, Asia
and virtually nothing Africa.
And, you know, I think
by understanding FTD better
in these populations,
we sort of enhance
the availability
to the pool of patients
that we needed,
we were able to study
and develop drugs
with because we need better
tools to understand FTD
in these populations
and better measurements
for end points as well.
Next slide, please.
And just want to illustrate
that other ways to make trials
more efficient
is through biomarkers,
and this is data that shows
that NfL really rises
dramatically
during the conversion stage
from asymptomatic to symptomatic
on the left here,
and so that may help us identify
patients that progress rapidly
and maybe decrease
the sample size.
And here in the middle is a
paper that shows that baseline
NfL levels may also
predict disease progression,
which may also help us
identify patients
that change more rapidly
during clinical trial.
And on the right here is a paper
from the ALLFTD group.
This shows the MRI
atrophy rates differ
and change in MAPT and granulin
gene mutation carriers,
but not so much in C9 carriers,
which also helps drug companies
design sample sizes
and treatment durations
as we are developing
therapies and clinical trials.
Next slide, please.
-We are at time.
-Oh, okay.
And finally, I just want to end
with, you know,
novel clinical trial designs
will also really help us.
On the left, I took a sample
from the HEALEY ALS Platform
Trial just to emphasize that,
you know, novel trial designs
can allow us to evaluate
multiple therapies,
decrease the placebo group
as they share placebo groups,
but a three
to one randomization.
And on the right here
is another example of a basket
trial conducted by UCS,
where we took a single drug
and evaluated it against
multiple diseases
in a single trial that all have
tau pathology.
And this also may increase the
efficiency of clinical trials,
so thank you for your time.
-Good afternoon, everyone,
and thank you for being here.
I'm Chiadi Onyike from Johns
Hopkins University
and along with Dr. Penny Dacks
from The Association
for Frontotemporal Dementia.
It falls on us both essentially
to land this ship.
We will be summarizing
the objectives
of our committees'
recommendations.
May I have the next slide,
please?
So for transparency,
I will mention
that I have sponsored research
with Alector
and conversations
with Transposon and Denali
about sponsored research,
and I'm also a consultant
with Alector.
Dr. Dacks has no disclosures.
Let's have the next one.
Thank you.
Now, the last 15 odd years
have been an especially
dynamic period for FTD research,
and the extraordinary leaps
in our knowledge
have been so well illustrated
in the early presentations,
as you've seen.
In saluting this progress then,
I would like to take a moment
to remember
two important figures
that we lost in the last year,
Professor John Trojanowski
and Professor Stuart
Pickering-Brown.
So their hugely influential
contributions are deeply,
deeply appreciated.
The new recommendations
are designed to build
on the progress since 2019,
and that's been a period
in which the leveraging of large
international FTD cohorts
primarily in North America
and Europe and new technologies,
leveraging the many
penetrating lines of research
have led to important clinical
and biological discoveries.
And these have yielded,
as Dr. Tsai
has just illustrated,
an impressive first wave
of disease-modifying
opportunities and drugs.
Now the activities that
are encapsulated
in any recommendations
are intended to build
on this momentum by firstly,
incorporating ethnocultural
and socioeconomic questions
at the clinical
and preclinical levels.
And this is explicit
in recommendation one,
but the recommendation
two speaks to it
in terms of access
of diagnosis and care,
and in recommendation
eight in terms
of linking
this preclinical level.
Now, we also expect to deepen
and cross-link
the preclinical lines
of research,
and this is illustrated
or mentioned
in recommendations four,
seven and eight.
There's an explicit emphasis
on preclinical drug development
activities in recommendations
five and six,
emphasis on translation
of discoveries
into buy markets and novel drugs
in recommendations two,
three, five and six.
And altogether,
the overarching agenda
is an expansion of clinical --
or the culminating agenda --
We expect this to culminate
in an expansion
of clinical trials
and treatments
that will arrest progression,
hopefully also
rehabilitate impairments.
So our committee has also
recognized
and sought to make explicit
in its recommendations
the importance of cross-
disciplinary collaboration
within and between preclinical
and clinical sciences
and across neurodegenerative
disease research communities.
In other words, it is our view
that cross-linking research
in FTD and ALS, in AD
and other ADRD fields
to identify biological
commonalities, intersections
and points of divergence
will accelerate discovery.
And this is explicitly codified
in recommendation four.
-Thank you, Dr. Onyike.
Our colleagues today have
outlined the incredible progress
in FTD research
over recent years.
As we all speak together
about the future,
we have to remember
that the progress to date
has not yet had
a tangible impact
on the lives of those
who suffer from FTD --
struggle with inequity
and access to accurate,
timely diagnoses --
fatal dementia with no --
with zero approved treatments
despite profounding
for both symptomatic
and disease-modifying therapies.
And despite that
sobering reflection,
when we look at
those recommendations we know
that the coming 3 years
will not take us fully
where we need to go.
But -- pragmatic, realistic
and incredibly exciting road map
to getting us closer
to improve peoples' lives.
Now, I want to make sure
that we have the time
for really a rich discussion,
so I'm going to just say
a couple things.
One is that the need for
more comprehensive understanding
of FTD in diverse populations
has been really richly,
eloquently articulated
into the prior session
and this one --
still in early stages
of understanding
how socioeconomic
and ethnocultural status
can affect disease
risk manifestations
as well as access to diagnosis,
care and research opportunities.
An array of biomarkers
to support diagnosis,
clinical monitoring
and clinical trial design
going to be foundationally
important to transform
how we define and treat these
disorders to categorize people
not only by
the clinical phenotype
that can be treated
symptomatically
but by the underlying
pathobiologies
that can be targeted with
disease-modifying therapies.
Since we are at time,
I'm going to skip
some of my remaining comments
and just say that on behalf
of all the families
that are out there
needing help,
thanks to all the researchers,
funders and companies
that are working on FTD
and the people
who are volunteering
to participate in research
and to spread awareness
of FTD and reduce stigma.
All of us working together
are the key
to improving peoples' lives.
-Yeah, Dr. Dacks, apologies
for having to cut you off.
So we are going to go
to the Q and A.
The first four people
that are in cue,
the cue is the Q and A box
at the bottom of your screen.
We've promoted them
over to panelists.
They can turn on their cameras
if you wouldn't mind.
The first question is going
to be from David Pfeifer,
and I'm going to yield back
to the chairs.
Thank you.
-Thank you all so very much.
I cannot see myself.
I'm not sure if you can see me,
but my name is David Pfeifer,
and I am the Board Chair,
the current Board Chair of AFTD.
I had prepared a few comments
regarding reaching
all with FTD diagnostic tools
and the need for biomarkers.
However, these very
thoughtful presentations
have touched on everything
that I had intended to say,
so I'm simply going to
include those in the Q and A
for the record.
I want to thank you all
for all of your hard work
on FTD research.
I lost my wife, Cathy,
in 2016 to FTD and ALS.
Most of all, I want to express
sincere thanks to the NIH
for the summit
and for funding this research,
which is advancing the science
and providing hope
to our entire community
that a true understanding
of these diseases
and effective therapeutics
are on the horizon.
I'd also like to note
that as was evidence
in our patient-focused
drug development meeting
with the FDA last year,
our community is extremely
energized and eager
to step up and participate
in the clinical trials
that are emerging.
We're ready to do our part once
the drugs reach clinical trials.
Again, thank you all
so very much
for all of the work
that you do.
-Thank you, appreciate it.
Does anyone on the panel want
to address anything from that,
or should I go
onto the next question?
-No, those are great comments.
Thank you, David,
and maybe the next.
-Matthew Sharp?
-Hi. Thanks for the opportunity
to comment today.
I'm Matt Sharp,
the Advocacy Manager with AFTD.
And I just want to say thank you
to the FTD working group
for making
a better understanding
of the epidemiology, genetics,
and risk and resilience factors
in FTD a top priority.
Inequity to access
in diagnostics
is a fundamental problem in FTD,
and it affects pretty much
everything from
the lived experience,
as well as research
participation.
So trying to understand
it better
is really the necessary
first step
in order to make advances
across the board.
That's all.
Thank you.
-All right.
Thank you.
-Thank you for those
great comments.
And, yes, you know, I just
thought I would comment
that one of our priorities
is to develop new biomarkers
and particularly biomarkers
that are more accessible
to people throughout the world,
but in different communities
so that we can make it easier
for an early and accurate
diagnosis of different FTDs.
So thank you for your comment.
Should we go onto
the next question?
-That sounds great.
The next one
is from Jean Swidler.
-Yes, hi.
Thank you all so much
for all the work you do.
My name is Jean Swidler.
I'm a leader in the pre-manifest
ALS and FTD genetic community.
I don't know if this
is fully understood
by everyone in this summit.
There are hundreds and thousands
of people
who are at risk for genetic FTD
in this country and, you know,
you have that about
half of them will have the gene.
And then you look at the slides
that Dr. Boxer showed.
About 30, 40 percent
of those people
are actively
undergoing neurodegeneration
as we speak ahead
of major symptoms.
So I did not see in the very
long page of recommendations
that was developed, and I'm sure
a lot of work went into that,
and I thank everyone for it,
I did not see
the word prevention once.
We need to be thinking of this
as a crisis
because it is a crisis.
If my brain is melting,
that's a problem.
And we know that there
are hundreds...
There's probably close
to 100,000 people
undergoing presymptomatic
neurodegeneration,
excessive neurodegeneration
in these genetic ALS families
and genetic FTD families
as we speak.
NfL is ready to go.
NfL is a surrogate end point.
We do not need to wait
for anything else.
If we should find out
these other ones, that's great.
That's excellent.
But we have this powerful tool
to measure neurodegeneration,
and guess what?
We can see if neurodegeneration
is modulated
with interventional therapies.
It's time, and, you know,
that really will unlock
the ability to have shorter
clinical trials,
to have clinical trials
for all these hundreds,
all these people undergoing
presymptomatic
neurodegeneration.
Also, you know,
I know we're not...
You know, this is NIH-focused,
but somehow we got to figure out
how to get neurofilament-light
as a commercial test.
It should not be locked
in research anymore.
You know, think about what this
could be doing
for people who are undergoing
FTD and interacting
with the court system
or the criminal justice system,
if people could have
their neurodegeneration measured
and, you know, show
that what's going on is relevant
to what's happening
in their life.
So those are my big things.
We need to focus on prevention
in addition
to treating people
with the disease.
We've got to focus on getting
NfL over the finish line here.
We've got to focus on, you know,
using the tools that we have.
Thank you so much.
-Right.
Those are really
terrific comments,
and I see that Penny Dacks
on the panel wanted to respond.
Penny?
-Yeah, thank you, Dr. Boxer.
And, Mrs. Swidler, I just wanted
to emphasize
how important what you said is,
that it may not be clear enough
in the recommendations
that prevention is absolutely
one of the main
focuses of those who are
doing clinical trials,
to find people who are at
the very stages of conversion
into symptomatic
manifestation of disease
so that that's manifestation
can be delayed.
I think it's a major focus
of all of the researchers,
and if that's not clear enough
in the recommendations,
then that's something
we can go back and revise.
And I hear you, as well,
in terms of neurofilament,
and I think there's
a lot of energy
there in trying to get it
validated to the point
that it can be used
in the clinic.
We very much are aligned
with your priorities,
and thank you
for the point about
how we can all
make it more clear.
-Any other comments from our
panelists -- responses?
I would just like to, you know,
add in thanks, Dr. Dacks,
for your comments.
Yeah, so, you know, I'm aware
that there are
a number of efforts
to qualify a neurofilament
and to bring it into the clinic.
And, you know, I think it's...
We hope that within
the next couple of years,
this will be a much more
clinically available test,
and completely agree
with Dr. Dacks' comment
that although we did mention
prevention trials
in one of our recommendations,
perhaps we could make
that a bit clearer.
But the global effort
that I mentioned,
the FTD Prevention Initiative,
is really targeting
what the question
was about that really,
we want to get to the point
where we can prevent
the onset of disease
and not just treat it.
So I think we'll move
onto the next question.
-That would be Esther Kane.
-Thank you.
So my name is Esther Kane,
and I am AFTD's Director
of Support and Education.
I am a registered nurse who has
spent most of my career
caring for those living
with dementia
and supporting
their care partners.
While progress is being made in
genetics and biomarker research,
a quick overview of funded
FTD-specific projects in eye
drop shows
that the number of projects
in care and services research
is dwarfed
by the number of projects
in basic translational
and clinical research.
In addition, there is already
a large population of people
with FTD
that are past the point of help
from disease-modifying
therapies.
The need for new and better
symptomatic therapies
is immediate,
and there are still precious
few medical options
to help people now.
We need to increasing funding
in research to assist
those living
with the disease now,
in addition to other research
initiatives.
Thank you.
-Thank you for that comment.
Do any of the panelists
want to respond?
I'll just say
that I completely agree,
and I think as we build a larger
clinical research population,
we really need to focus
on these other issues much more.
So thank you for the comment.
Maybe we'll move onto
the next question.
-That would be great.
So Arvind?
-Yeah. So thank you,
[Indistinct].
So my question is linked
to diagnostic
and presymptomatic conditions.
What the biomarker we have --
capable enough
to diagnose people
who have presymptomatic
or asymptomatic situation,
and if not, then what effort
going on to finding that?
Thank you.
-So that's a terrific question,
and I think, you know,
I'll start, but I'm going to ask
some of the panelists whether,
you know, you guys would also
want to comment as well.
So we're very limited.
We heard about
neurofilament-light chain,
and I showed a little bit
of data very quickly
as something
that seems to change
before the onset of symptoms
in genetic forms of FTD.
And we also have seen
that brain volume changes occur,
and yet those are really
the two biomarkers
that are changing the most.
And we have very few other
biomarkers that we can use,
and so in our
international efforts
to model the onset of disease,
it seems that we can start
to describe
what happens
before the onset of symptoms
but not accurately enough,
we think,
that we can really effectively
and in all cases predict exactly
when someone will get sick.
So there's still a lot
of uncertainty,
and that's why we think that
even more, you know, biomarkers,
whether they be biologic,
fluid biomarkers,
different types of brain scans,
PET scans,
looking at particular
molecular species,
but also clinical changes
and maybe remote monitoring
with movement changes,
or subtle
behavioral or clinical changes,
social changes.
All of these are likely
to be important,
and we think should be
a focus of future research.
Other comments?
Any of the panelists
want to respond?
-Or if not,
I completely agree,
and did that answer
your question?
-Yes, thank you.
-So maybe we'll move onto
the next question.
-Kathleen Welsh-Balmer?
-Yeah, hi.
Kathy Welsh-Balmer here
from Duke University.
I'm with the Duke Clinical
Research Institute
in the Duke/UNC ADRC.
It's tremendous the amount
of progress that's been made
just since 2019 recommendations.
So I can't keep up with it,
and I just applaud
all the panelists in summarizing
what is an incredible amount
of discovery
that's occurred
in just several years.
My comment really echoes
what you were just saying, Adam,
which is, you know,
it's incredible the work
that's been done
and the progress made
in the biomarker area.
As we move particularly
into the presymptomatic area
and start to look
for end points
for clinical trials,
or even end points for
monitoring patients in practice,
I think there really
does need to be
some emphasis on the development
of novel end points,
the pick-up
on the clinical expression
of these diverse types of FTDs,
whether that is
the social end points,
cognitive functional,
behavioral motor.
I think there's tremendous
opportunity,
and I'd love to see
the investment of effort
in developing those
clinical end points
similar to what we've done
with the development
of biological biomarkers.
Thank you.
-Yeah, those are great comments.
Thank you.
And maybe I wanted to ask --
Oh, it looks like
Dr. Onyike raised his hand.
So I was just about to call on
you, so, great.
-Okay, yes.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Thank you, Adam.
Thank you, Kathleen.
Yes, we completely agree.
Adam touched on this earlier,
and there is actually also work
and already work in the field,
you know, seeking to
address this question.
You know, I think one
of the challenges is trying
to figure out
where the goalpost should lie,
especially in relation
to clinical trials.
The earlier you go, of course,
the more difficult it is
to use clinical indices.
And so part of the effort
involves, for example,
linking clinical outcomes
or clinical indices
to physiological measurements,
whether they be
electrophysiological,
which is an interesting
new area...
Or not so new,
but a re-emphasized area,
and then also linking it
to other things,
blood-based biomarkers,
CSF-based biomarkers
because we have to, you know,
adjust the goalpost according
to the therapeutic goals.
And so we're going to need
a multitude
and the diversity
of what are biomarkers
to address these objectives,
and that's implicit
in the recommendations.
It's unfortunately difficult
to specify
everything in the documents.
-Thanks.
Thanks, Dr. Onyike.
And Dr. Irwin also wanted
to respond, I believe.
-Yeah, I just wanted
to briefly comment to agree
on the need for different
objective clinical measures
and that link to biology
in a biologically
heterogeneous disorder,
the importance of brain donation
to try to help link
some of the clinical physiology
that we see microscopically,
the antemortem biomarkers,
I think is also important.
-Great.
If there are no more comments
from the panelists,
then maybe we'll move
onto the next question.
-Mr. Ellenbogen.
-Can you hear me?
-Sound clear.
-Over the years, I participated
in about 12 clinical trials.
At that time,
they thought I had Alzheimer's.
Since the science
has gotten better,
they now believe I have semantic
dementia, which falls under FTD.
Since my second diagnosis,
I have not been able
to get into
any clinical trials.
Why must we be placed into a box
with this specific type
of dementia
when I actually learned
right here at NIH
that 50 to 60 percent of those
who had a biopsy after death
died of three or four types
of dementia?
On another note,
I don't want to sound like
a conspiracy theorist,
but I've been living
with dementia for a long time.
I would have never said
this in the past,
but I do believe I found
a way to address
a way to delay dementia
by using a cocktail of drugs
and other habit-changing ways.
While I cannot say this
with certainty,
I do have some proof
it's working.
I'd be happy to speak to anyone
who may be interested
in chatting with me about this.
I would sure hate
to just be ignored
when there may actually
be something here
that could actually help others.
Thank you.
-Well, I wanted to thank you,
Mr. Ellenbogen,
for your comments.
And thank you also for
participating in research
in so many clinical trials,
and, you know,
I want to say I'm sorry
that it's taken such a long time
to get an accurate diagnosis.
I think your points
are very well taken,
and one of our recommendations
is around
developing
new clinical trial designs.
And one idea is that maybe,
you know,
we could think about different
ways of testing therapies
or finding what helps people
so that we're not so exclusive,
or that anyone who feels --
who is part of the community
could participate.
So one idea is called
a pragmatic clinical trial,
where we would allow many
different people to participate
and share their experiences,
perhaps, you know, the cocktail
that you've developed or learned
about that's helping you.
And we would love to learn
and get more about that as well,
and so we hope that
through other recommendations
where we're developing
less expensive
and easier-deployed biomarkers
and clinical measures,
that might enable
clinical trials sort of
like you're suggesting
that more people
could participate in.
So I also want to call again
on Dr. Onyike,
who wanted to comment
as well, I think,
unless your hand was...
-Yeah, no.
Thank you, Michael.
I think in addition
to what Dr. Boxer
has just gone over,
you also highlighted the issue
of delayed, you know,
late diagnosis
and what that can mean
for access to clinical trials.
And this is a reason why there's
an explicit emphasis on the...
And I recall, you mentioned
in the earlier panel the issue,
how it relates
to diverse communities.
And so this is a reason
why we have an explicit focus
on these ethnocultural
and socioeconomic,
if you will,
factors that influence,
essentially permeate everything
that we're trying to do here
including, in particular,
access to care
and access to timely diagnosis.
So I just wanted
to thank you again
for highlighting those issues
and giving us the opportunity
to speak to them.
Thank you.
-Thanks.
We're close to time.
Do we have time for one
more question, Keith?
-We're going to extend
into the break a little bit
and hope to have a couple more,
actually.
So, Dr. Niehoff?
-Thank you.
I'm Debra Niehoff,
and I'm the Director of Research
and Grants for AFTD.
And many of the advances
that we've heard so well
described this afternoon
are the result
of the increasing wealth
of genomic, transcriptomic,
epigenomic, proteomic,
and biomarker data.
But one type of data that's
still in very short supply
is quantitative data,
and that would be information
on parameters
such as association,
dissociation rates
for critical
protein-protein interactome,
binding constants,
catalytic rates.
And these are data
that could not only reveal
unknown vulnerabilities in
the Tau or TDP-43 interaction.
They could also be the starting
point for computational
and mechanistic modeling
that could generate novel
hypotheses about disease,
pathogenesis and progression.
And I'm wondering if the panel
could please comment
on the lack of quantitative data
and whether under
recommendation five,
one of the goals could be to
encourage the acquisition
of such data.
-Yes, and I'm going to ask
some of the panelists.
Anyone want to comment,
since I've been speaking a lot?
-Yeah. So I think that
I totally agree with you
that there's going
to be huge value
to expanding our ability
to leverage the genomic findings
and to use
these quantitative traits
to extend our understanding
of disease,
both to distinguish between
different FTD subtypes
and to understand converging
indistinct mechanisms.
-Thanks.
So I think we have time
just for a few more comments...
Oh, I think Anthony
wanted to make a comment.
-Yeah. I would just add
to what Celeste said.
With regard to the quantitative
aspect, Deb,
I think that, you know,
cryo-EM as a tool
has been very powerful,
and, you know,
our lab and others
have really shown the power
of understanding
the filament structures,
individual filaments
when we extract them
from postmortem human tissue.
But I think in the context
of those interactions
and the interactome,
as you mentioned,
in think that cryotomography
is going to play a great role
in the coming years
to understand
when we directly visualize
the filaments in situ
and watch the various
interactions happening,
and what those filaments
are actually doing
in the context of disease,
I think that's going to be
very powerful
for the field moving forward.
-Great. So maybe just a few
more comments and questions,
and I think we're going to
the break a little bit,
but thank you for your patience.
I believe that Dr. Barnes
had a comment.
I don't know
if she's still online.
But, Dr. Barnes,
did you want to discuss
your comment a little bit more?
-Oh, hi.
Well, I just --
My comment was just about
your opening statement,
and not to call you out,
because I think
we're all guilty of it,
but that we often make
this artificial separation
between recruitment
and rigor of science,
and I just think
that we need to think
about diversity, inclusion
and equity
as integral to everything
we do in research
because it's going to impact
how we are able to recruit,
how we're able to keep
people in our studies,
and the community can tell that
we're looking at these things
in two different ways.
So I guess the general point
is that they're not separate
and that we need to think
about it
as a key to our scientific
progress in this area.
-Yeah, and I --
You know, I apologize
if I misspoke.
That's sort of the point
that I wanted to make as well,
but I didn't do it
in a very eloquent way,
so thank you for clarifying
and emphasizing that point.
Thank you.
I think there were two
more comment --
or maybe we have time
for one more comment.
-David, you're next in line.
-My apologies.
I don't have a question.
I just put my...
-Okay.
-...those comments, as I had
mentioned in my remarks,
I think all these thoughtful
presentations had addressed,
so I don't have
any further follow-up.
-Thanks, appreciate that.
-Thank you.
-Zeynep Demir.
This will be your last question
before we go to lunch.
-Hey.
I'm a clinical fellow
at the NIH.
I have a quick question.
We are working on developing
early MRI markers,
and I am curious,
is there any platform specific
to those imaging markers
and how we can collaborate?
-I'll take that, and yes.
So the ALLFTD study
is collecting MRI.
I'm not sure if your question
is about
the availability of data or --
Yeah, so you can apply --
-Reaching out the patient
as well.
-I'm sorry.
I didn't understand that last.
-Oh, sorry.
We are collecting the data
as well as reaching out
the patients,
so testing our markers as well,
so just collaborate as a site.
-Yeah, so let's discuss
that offline
if you want to send me
an e-mail, or we could --
can also contact us
through our website.
Great.
But definitely happy to discuss.
Well, I think we're probably
out of time
and want to thank
all of the panel members
as well as everyone who made
comments and asked questions,
and apologies
to those individuals
who we didn't get to,
but we will definitely
address your comments
in the recommendations
and try to do our best offline.
Thanks again.
-And it's my pleasure
to introduce to you
our session cochairs, Drs.
Donna Wilcock and Ron Petersen.
Welcome.
-Thank you, Natalia.
Thank you to the NINDS
for their organization.
It's my pleasure to open
the VCID session this afternoon,
and I think we've got
a great session for you.
We've got a wonderful committee,
and everybody has worked really
hard on these recommendations,
so we look forward
to your input at the end.
Please can we go
to the next slide?
So my disclosures, I think
you've seen this from everybody.
So these are my views,
not necessarily official views
of the NIH,
and I do not have any financial
disclosures to make.
Next slide, please.
So VCID, vascular contributions
to cognitive impairment
and dementia,
the science of VCID
really does overlay
these two clinical syndromes,
clinical stroke where we think
about cardio
and cerebrovascular disease
and then the clinical
Alzheimer's and dementia
where we think more about
cognitive decline and dementia,
and I love this image,
and this image
was from Dr. Corriveau.
Next slide, please.
Because of this complexity,
the science of VCID
I think is truly
interdisciplinary.
When we think about
the science of VCID,
even just thinking about
the neurovascular unit
where a lot of the insults
are occurring in the brain,
you have such a density
of different cell types
in that area, astrocytes,
neurons, pericytes, microglia,
capillaries,
smooth muscle cells.
They all meet in
that neurovascular unit,
and so there are many
different specialists,
special areas of focus
to think about,
cerebrovascular and
cardiovascular, biology.
We have metabolism.
We have the different
proteinopathies with dementia,
which VCID often is comorbid
with some of,
if not all of,
these proteinopathies,
and then we also have unique
immune responses.
Next slide, please.
And you'll hear about
some of those
in the presentations
this afternoon.
VCID also reflects really
an umbrella
of different
vascular pathologies,
and so some of these
might be more associated
with a modest
cognitive impairment
whereas some may actually
be associated more
with a full dementia,
and these run on a spectrum
as you can see there
on the left.
So we have pathologies
like microinfarcts,
microbleeds, very common,
very, very focal
and a lone, a single one,
may not have an impact.
Multiple, obviously,
the more you accumulate,
the more likely you are to have
a functional outcome from those,
and then we move
through silent strokes, TIAs.
Obviously, CADASIL is
a genetic condition
that we think about with respect
to small vessel disease,
and then we start to get into
the larger vessel involvement
where you have a much larger
area of the brain involved,
CAA, ischemic stroke,
hemorrhagic stroke,
and so as a committee,
we feel that it's really
important to develop
clinical outcomes,
biomarkers,
interventions that are
going to match
these particular vascular
injuries and diseases.
VCID most certainly will not be
a one-size-fits-all,
and I think that's why
those of us
who study it embrace that
heterogeneity that exists there,
and so for successful
VCID intervention,
we need mechanisms.
We need interventions.
We need biomarkers,
and we need clinical trials,
and hopefully you'll hear
about plans for all of those
and where we think
the field should move.
Next slide, please.
So I just want to take a second
to thank our committee.
Everybody, I'm not going
to name everybody,
but we had
a wonderful committee.
A lot of work went into this,
and what you see is a product
of everybody's input.
Next slide, please.
So we're going to have three
presentations this afternoon.
The first is the Focus Area 1.
So our recommendations
are broken down
into three focus areas,
Focus Area 1, basic mechanisms
and experimental models,
and Dr. Andy Shih
from Seattle Children's Hospital
is going to speak to you
about those recommendations.
Focus Area 2 is
three recommendations
focused around human studies,
and Dr. Prashanthi Vemuri
will be presenting
those recommendations,
and she is from the Mayo Clinic,
and then our last focus area,
we have two recommendations
on translational studies,
and Dr. Sudha Seshardi
will be presenting those,
and she is from
the University of Texas
Health Science Center
in San Antonio.
So without further ado,
I will hand over
to Dr. Andy Shih,
who will present those first
focus area recommendations.
Thank you, Andy.
>> Thanks, Donna.
And real honored to speak
on behalf of the committee
and all that
we've discussed.
Next slide, please.
So these are my disclaimers
and disclosures.
These are my own views,
not of the NIH,
but they were shaped and guided
by the committee members,
and I receive funding from the
NIH and NINDS for ADRD research.
Next slide.
So what I'm focusing on today
is on the basic mechanism
and experimental models
that we use to study VCID
at a preclinical level.
Now, I want to emphasize how
important animal models are here
because it is the sandbox,
essentially,
that we use to study
the different mechanisms
that might be contributing
to disease
but also where we start to,
you know,
test whether the drugs
that we have come up with
are actually useful
in treating the disease.
We talked about a lot of things
in these meetings,
but we have the painful,
you know,
role of trying to distill down
all these important topics,
the three recommendations
that I'm going dig a lot deeper
into in this talk:
so, first, to establish
and refine experimental models
and technologies to identify
disease-relevant mechanisms
that underlie VCID;
second,
to study the neurovascular
unit structure and function
and to establish
how it is impacted by VCID;
and then, three,
to use experimental models
to investigate
how aging cerebrovascular
and cardiovascular disease
impacts myelin,
white matter degeneration
and neurodegeneration.
Next slide.
So when we start to think
about modeling VCID,
we have to appreciate that VCID
is really an umbrella term
for many different
vascular disease
processes that are happening
in a human,
and all these
processes converge down
to create neurodegeneration
and cognitive decline.
The vascular problems
can exist
both extracranially
in the large vessels
but also in the small vessels
within the brain,
the arteries,
the small arterioles,
capillaries and venules,
and various types of pathologies
occurring at all these different
levels of the vasculature
can lead to a progressive loss
of vascular perfusion
and structure,
and this might involve
occlusion of the vessels,
partial occlusion
of the vessels,
impairment of the responsivity
of the vessels,
damage to the vessel wall
that cause them to leak
or various types
of inflammatory reactions
in the vessels
that impair the perfusion.
Next slide, please.
So we're tasked with trying
to model
a constellation of
different disease processes,
and by looking at this,
you can already imagine
that there is no magic bullet.
There's no one model
that captures the complexity
of what's going on
in the human brain,
and so therefore,
we have to think about,
as we develop models,
a number of fundamental
core concepts
that we have to keep
with each of the new models
that we develop,
and they're listed here.
So, first, they have to
reproduce small vessel disease
and other key
pathogenic mechanisms
thought to result
in cognitive impairment
and that reflect
the human condition.
Second, they have to
address contributions to damage
in both the white matter
and the gray matter.
Three, they have to include
genetic
and acquired conditions that are
associated with human VCID,
and three, because aging
is the key risk factor
that we all can't avoid,
incorporating aging
as a key factor
in the disease progression
is going to be very important.
Next slide.
So because the pathogenic
diversity of VCID
is so great,
it's logical for us
to be creating many
different types of models,
and each of these models
should recapitulate features
of the human disease
process.
So we have many models now
that reproduce different
clinically
relevant manifestations
that we see in
the pathology postmortem
but also using
in vivo MRI,
and they include topics such
as white matter degeneration,
lacunar strokes,
cerebral microinfarcts,
microbleeds,
superficial siderosis,
dilated perivascular spaces,
and certainly as we study
these injuries to the vessels,
we want to understand
how they are contributing
to neurodegeneration
and the disease progression,
but we also need to think
earlier in the etiology
of when these arise.
We know that these are actually
end points
of a vascular disease.
Next slide.
Or next, yeah.
And so therefore,
we need to think about --
In order to really define
therapeutic targets,
we need to think about
the early microvascular changes
that are occurring that have
created these manifestations,
and there's numerous
different types,
and I've just listed
a few here,
but I'm certain
that you can all think
of many different types
of vascular pathologies
that could lead
to these fundamental outcomes.
Next slide.
So when we think about
the models that exist
in our field right now,
we're actually quite rich.
We have got many different types
of models to think about,
ranging from ones
that are induced,
for example using
a surgical manipulation
to go and modify the way
that blood flows into the brain
or to include small vessels.
We've got dietary strategies
that will mimic comorbid factors
such as diabetes
and high-fat diet.
We've got genetic factors,
for example manipulating
or knocking out genes
that are involved,
known to be involved
in human VCID,
and there's a wide variety
of different types
with different phenotypes.
Embedded
within these genetic models
are CAA mice or models
of Alzheimer's disease,
where they try to overexpress
amyloid beta
or express amyloid
beta from the human,
and they sometimes lead
to the aggregation of amyloid
beta around the outside
of the vessel,
creating cerebral
amyloid angiopathy,
or also called CAA.
So when you think about
the different types of models
that could be used,
you have to first dial down
to your research question,
you know, what is the question
that you're going after,
and find the right model
that fits that question in order
to really utilize the tools
that we have at our disposal.
So for example, if you wanted to
study white matter degeneration,
you've got to be sure
that these models
have white matter
degeneration in them.
Next.
So this is where we come --
we fall a little bit short.
We would think that most
of these models
are actually relatively
undercharacterized
with respect to the types of
vascular pathologies that exist,
when they arise and also
that behavioral phenotype
that might arise
in these animals,
so we need this information in
order to make critical decisions
about which models
are appropriate.
Next.
And also, we sometimes
take these models
and mix them
with other models
in order to study
certain cell types,
and when we do so,
we mix genetic backgrounds,
and we now know that depending
on the genetic background
of the mouse,
the phenotype of the model
might change significantly,
so we have to be careful
of that as well.
Next.
It also then makes sense
to think
about adding these
different models together,
mixing them
and multiplexing them,
and here are some examples
of what have been.
You know, models that
are relevant to CAA
can be mixed
with models of dietary
or lifestyle-acquired
pathologies,
and you can imagine
this leads to an explosion
in the richness of the different
possibilities to explore,
and it creates additional
features of VCID pathology
that you can't necessarily see
with one individual model
on its own.
Next.
So here's one example
from Cos and Nicole's lab,
a really nice
one that shows the ApoE4 mice,
you know, that express the main
risk factor ApoE4 for AD,
these animals don't have white
matter hypoperfusion or hypoxia
until you give them BCAS,
which is the bilateral
carotid artery stenosis model,
and you don't see that
with the wild-type or the ApoE3.
Next.
But there are some gaps.
Although we're rich in
the different models,
most of them are mirroring,
and we have to think about
higher-order mammals as well.
The higher-order mammals
will allow us to study more
because their brains
are larger.
They can show additional
phenotypes
or features
of VCID pathology
that we don't see
in a simple mouse brain.
Their larger brains
have more white matter,
and because
they have larger brains,
the limited
spatial resolution of MRI
can be used to study the defects
a little bit more closely.
Further, you can use
these larger animal models
to do sophisticated
neurocognitive testing.
Next.
And so here's one example
from Bill Van Nostrand
and Helena Benveniste
recently where they developed
a CAA model of rat
where the rat brain
is about four
to five times larger
than the mouse brain,
and you can see here that there
is white matter degeneration
occurring within this model,
and they've been using
this model with MRI
to very carefully track
white matter degeneration
using routine MRI clinical
scanning approaches.
Next.
We also want to think
about larger mammals
beyond the rat as well.
There are important studies
that are being done in canine,
porcine and nonhuman
primate animals
that are going to be important
to further study as well.
Next.
Now, moving to the other end
of the scale,
there are also important
developments in the
in vitro space as well.
The reductionist methods of in
vitro models are very important,
not only because this is where
we can do a lot of drug testing
but also because a lot of times,
the animal model,
the vasculature
in the animal models
might not represent what's
going on in the human brain.
So, therefore, we need to take
human tissues
and try to culture them.
So in this space, the inducible
pluripotent stem cells
from human tissue
highlighted here
from Li-Huei Tsai's lab
has been used to differentiate
into different types
of vessel cell types,
including endothelial cells
and mural cells and astrocytes,
that then can be collated back
together again into hydrogels
and then be developed
into cell culture systems
that have a human
blood-brain-barrier-like
phenotype.
Next slide.
And so these models are going
to be very important
for understanding mechanism
but also drug testing as well,
but care is needed to ensure
that they are reasonably
modeling in vivo features
of the vascular cell types
in vivo or in humans.
Next.
We've also been very excited
by the development
and application
of next-generation technologies.
In particular
in the last 3 years,
some really exciting techniques
have come about that,
if applied to VCID research,
can be very, very insightful.
They include deep
multiphoton microscopy
to image subcortical
white matter in vivo,
more sophisticated cognitive
and behavioral
testing approaches
such as touch screen
testing for mice and rodents,
which mimic more what we're
doing in the clinic as well;
home cage assessments
that look across the clock
to understand what the animals
are doing in their cages;
higher resolution MRI
and CT and PET modalities;
spatial proteomics
and transcriptomic analyses;
and finally, CRISPR editing,
gene editing approaches
to create more physiologically
relevant rodent models.
Next.
And so just one highlight
from Chris Xu's lab
where they've used multicolor
three-photon microscopy
to study the neural
and vascular architecture
and function of blood vessels
within the white matter,
so that blue streak
in the middle of that image
on the left
shows the white matter,
and now we're able to image
all the way down to that
in the living brain of an animal
in order to study
what's going on
to the blood vessels over time
and also to study
the different cell types
and the responses
to the blood vessel
changes that are occurring,
and we can even image much
deeper beyond the white matter,
into the hippocampus,
opening up completely
different types of questions
to the research field.
Next.
We want to continue
investigation
of how neurovascular
unit contributions
are regulating neurovascular
coupling and basal blood flow.
The area of understanding
how blood flow
is regulated in the brain
is still an actively
researched area,
but in order to get at
what is going on
in the diseased condition,
we need to understand
the fundamentals
of blood flow regulation
in the normal brain.
Next.
And so one thing that we'd like
to do is encourage researchers
to think about
the neurovascular unit
across the different
microvascular zones
and think about how
VCID pathology
affects each of these zones.
The extracranial vessels
in comparison
to the smaller
intercranial vessels
are completely different
in their composition,
in their thickness,
in their dynamics,
and therefore,
disease mechanisms that act
on the different zones
of the blood vessels
might have completely
different underlying bases.
Not included in this diagram
are also veins.
All that blood has to come
through the arteries
and come out
through the veins,
and we don't really think
about veins very much
in the context of VCID.
So it's important to think about
the drainage networks as well.
Next.
So some very exciting work
in this area of single-cell
and spatial technologies
for transcriptomic analysis
of the cerebrovasculature
has come about
in the last 5 years or so.
Pioneering work from
Christopher Bechtel
has shown that it's possible
to isolate blood vessels
from the adult mouse brain,
and this has been used
to study the transcriptional
phenotypes of cells
across different zones
of the blood vessels
within the cerebrovasculature.
Next.
And -- Next, please.
Oops, sorry, go back.
Something didn't pop up here.
Okay.
Interestingly, the --
Even more recently,
just in the last month or so,
new work has come out from
a number of different groups
showing that it's also possible
to isolate blood vessels
from fresh human brain tissue,
and this has led to,
essentially, a nice correlate
across comparison
between the animal studies
and the human studies
that allow us to think about the
cell types of the blood vessels,
driving the possibility
of exciting new hypotheses
in the animal research arena
but also to help us think
about what we might be missing
with animal models
or what types of differences
are not captured adequately
between the mouse
and the human brain vasculature,
and what do we need to do
to make them align better.
Next.
-Two minutes remaining.
-Okay.
We also have to think about
the clearance mechanisms
of waste from the brain,
and the vasculature has become
a central focus in this.
Removal of waste metabolites
through the blood-brain barrier
along perivascular spaces
that are filled with CSF or
through phagocytic degradation
need to be thought
about more carefully.
Next.
And in particular,
dilated perivascular spaces,
which are often seen
as an increased risk factor
and increased with age and also
with vascular risk factors
are interesting biomarkers,
perhaps, for VCID,
but we'd also want to understand
what this actually means
for brain clearance
in the context
of human neuroimaging.
Next.
So this is where animal models
come back into the spotlight.
A lot of these questions
are very difficult
to address
in the human brain,
but if we could study them
in the rodent brain
or in the animal brain,
we can get
much more information,
and so recent studies
from Macon Utgaard's lab,
for example, are shown,
the ability to use optical
imaging to track the movement
of dyes or different small beads
that have been injected
into the CSF.
MRI has also been used to watch
the diffusion
of intercortically injected dyes
within the interstitial space
to see how they clear
over time.
Next.
But also different --
It's becoming more clear
that different types
of physiological rhythms
might be involved
in augmenting this clearance
and driving the clearance of CSF
and metabolic waste as well,
and this is heartbeat,
breathing,
vasomotor oscillations
of the blood vessels,
neural activity, sleep.
A lot of different factors
might be involved,
and so animal models can be used
to help disentangle
some of these complexities.
Thanks.
We also want to think
about the cells
that actually make
the white matter white,
the oligodendrocytes.
We know that white matter is
particularly vulnerable in VCID,
but yet we know very little
about the pathophysiology
of oligodendrocytes
and the repair mechanisms
that are involved --
that they mount in the face of
vascular and neurodegeneration.
Next.
And so through in vivo
imaging approaches --
Next, yeah.
-Time has expired.
-Oh, okay, very quick.
Yeah, and so through using
in vivo
imaging approaches here
from Ethan Hughes Lab,
you can see that you can
track the remodeling
and the remyelination
of these cells over time
in living animals,
and then next.
My final slide here
is just to say
that the development
of new tools
are what lead to major gap
leaps within our insight
into a disease progression,
and so we want to encourage
the development of new tools,
and this is just one slide
showing from [Indistinct] lab
at University
of Southern California
that's designed
a new Cre driver
that allows us to target
a very specific cell type
within the brain, a pericyte,
that wouldn't have been possible
without single-cell
transcriptomic analyses
identifying specific genes
that allow us to do
this genetic targeting.
So with that,
I'd like to thank you.
Sorry for going over
a little bit,
and I'll pass the baton
onto Prashanthi Vemuri.
-Thank you, Andy.
It's an honor to be here
on behalf of the committee
and represent
the great discussions
we had coming up
with these recommendations.
Next, please.
I have nothing to disclose.
Next.
So the recommendations
came through based on three
guiding principles specific
to human studies.
VCID is really common.
It coexists with other
deteriorative pathologies,
so detection and screening
for these is very important.
Number two,
on the next slide,
is that VCID is preventable.
So there's decreasing prevalence
of raised blood pressure
because of better blood
control across the globe,
and this has resulted
in declining incidence rate
of dementia in Europe and U.S.A.
across seven studies.
So the fact that VCID
is preventable
is an important
fact to consider
when designing
these recommendations.
The next slide shows
that we understand VCID
as a heterogeneous
and a broad phenomenon.
So it captures all forms of
cerebrovascular brain injury,
not solely stroke.
Therefore, studying this
in the context
of mild
cognitive impairment
or fully developed dementia
is really important,
and these are the three
guiding principles
that set us up
for the recommendations,
and we also wanted to take
into consideration
the progress
that has been made so far.
Next slide, please.
Next.
There's been tremendous progress
that has been made in VCID,
like Donna alluded
to right in the beginning,
but one of the major
improvements in the field
has been that in the last
couple of decades,
we really understand the
mechanisms and biology of VCID,
like Dr. Shih showed.
Here's an example of studies
across NIH-funded VCID cohorts.
These are examples of studies,
and we have tried to understand
how risk factors, lifestyle
as well as genetic variants
can express and increase
the risk
for large
and small vessel diseases
as well as contribute
to the burden of dementia.
Next.
We've also gotten really good
with imaging markers of VCID.
I'd really like to look
at the image
on the top left in blue,
which shows some
of the earliest images
of white matter
hyperintensities,
which are manifestations
of vascular disease,
and from then to now, these
are images taken last year.
You can really see that
on the top panel,
we have gotten very good
at detecting lesions,
quantifying them.
At the bottom panel, you can see
that we have quantitative
imaging available right now
in human studies
where we can capture various
aspects of the brain
as well as measure
vessel structure and function.
So we made tremendous
progress there.
Next slide, please.
We've also been able
to try and understand
what the clinical implications
of VCID are.
So if someone has a positive
amyloid scan,
how do the vascular
disease contributions
add onto Alzheimer's disease
and cause cognitive impairment,
which is very similar
over an age range
of 70 plus or 5 years.
And on the next slide,
I'll talk about the successes
that have come through
AD/ADRD summits,
where there's several
NIH initiatives for VCID.
MarkVCID, which has been focused
on analyzing,
optimizing and validating
VCID biomarkers
and has really brought
into the field of AD/ADRD
to have tools to be able
to detect vascular disease.
DISCOVERY Study, which has been
fantastic at bringing together
and trying to understand
mechanisms of poststroke VCID.
And the newly funded
DiverseVCID,
which has been focused
on white matter lesions
in diverse individuals
across US.
So we did -- have made
a lot of progress in VCID,
but when the committee met,
on the next slide,
we thought that
our recommendations
should reflect
the common theme
across all the things
that I've talked about so far
as well as consider the progress
that we've made so far.
Next slide.
Before I get into
the recommendation,
I wanted to bring this health
equity concept back again
because in each of
the recommendations
that we talked about,
the crosscutting theme
was that specific populations
with high vascular risk factors,
as well as inequalities,
are not considered
in the studies
that we're conducting
right now.
And this should be a key aspect
of what we're going
to do in the future.
After setting up this,
we came up with recommendations,
and the first recommendation
was developing
and validating markers of VCID.
So one might say that they made
a lot of progress.
We have imaging markers.
We have emerging plasma markers.
Why would we need
this recommendation?
The committee felt that,
on the next slide,
their could be
cost-effective ways
to measure the presence
and progression of VCID.
If you remember the first slide
that I showed,
VCID is extremely common,
so we really need
cost-effective ways
to be able to detect
the presence of VCID
and track
the progression of VCID.
There's several ways
you could go about it,
and I wanted to give you
two examples
to kind of get us
thinking about,
what kind of tools would be
optimal to consider this?
Next slide, please.
This is a simple example
of how you could look
at the electronic health care
records and look at the ICD-9,
10 codes for the patients
in the health care records
and consider
the seven conditions
proposed by US Department
of Health and Human Services
for measuring cardiovascular
metabolic conditions.
In this particular example,
what we did was we looked
at individuals
who had two or more
of these conditions,
a very simple cutoff,
and we found that people who had
two or more of these conditions,
which can be easily obtained,
are predictable of greater
white matter hyperintensities,
which is manifestation
of vascular disease,
as well as greater
progression over time.
So tools like this
could be very helpful.
Next slide, please.
There's another example
that Dr. Eric Smith
brought up,
which was --
which elegantly looked
at natural language
processing in EHR
and how you could
actually look at MRI
and CT scans for a non-stroke
indication in EHR
and come up with ways in which
you can detect people
who are at greater
risk of dementia
because of vascular
cognitive contributions
to impairment and dementia.
In this particular study,
they said that when
they looked at CT and MRI,
they were able to recognize and
identify a group of individuals
who are at greater risk of
declining over the next 5 years,
which is a tremendous
progress.
Next slide.
We talked about new markers.
The other thing that
was recurring
when we talked
about markers was that,
we need to refine and validate
the markers we have.
We're doing a really good job
with coming up with markers.
For example, plasma NfL
is a fantastic marker
for several vascular disease,
but we also talk about
being a great marker
for other neurodegenerative
diseases.
There is emerging evidence
that plasma NfL values
are impacted by renal function.
So considering them
while you're measuring it,
refining your measurements
will go a long way.
The other aspect of that, goal
standard is always pathology.
We can come up with biomarkers.
We can measure them, but what
do they mean pathologically?
That meets a better focus
than we have done in the past.
Next slide, please.
And the elephant in the room,
or the elephant
and the six blind men,
is that we have been --
We understand the concept three,
which is VCID
is extremely broad.
When we are measuring
biomarkers,
we need more specificity,
and we need to consider
the heterogeneity.
When we are saying VCID,
what are we exactly measuring,
and what is the contribution
of our biomarker
to the measurement
we are making?
In some certain senses,
it could be a blood-brain
barrier dysfunction.
In other cases, it could be
white matter damage
that Dr. Shir talked
about in his presentation.
But increasing the specificity
and understanding the
heterogeneity in the population
as well as in the ways
it manifests,
vascular disease manifests,
is very important.
Next slide.
So as I said, recommendation
four was focused on biomarkers.
How do we develop new,
better biomarkers
as well as refine what we have?
Recommendation five was given
a priority two,
and we thought interventions,
especially given the fact
that VCID is preventable,
there should be
a focus on interventions.
Developing and identifying
as well
as validating interventions,
testing the efficacy
as well as treatment of VCID
across spectrum of severity
as well as
in diverse populations
is extremely important.
On the next slide, you'll see
that the committee brought up
the SPRINT Mind Study,
where it's been shown
that intensive blood pressure
controls can reduce
the risk of MCI and dementia.
So trying to focus back on
what randomized clinical trials
can we begin
and test the efficacy of?
There are a wide range
of vascular risk factors
we could target
and how we could target them.
But designing them
and optimizing them
should be a priority,
so we can translate it
into prevention.
And we also talked about
incorporating biomarkers
in our clinical trials.
When we talked about
the biomarkers for VCID,
more often than not,
they're not included
in other AD/ADRD studies
for when you're studying,
let's say, FTD
or Alzheimer's disease.
But the point I'd like
to bring across
is that we thought given that
VCID is manifested along
with several
neurodegenerative diseases,
incorporating VCID markers,
some of them
MarkVCID initiative,
would be helpful
across all studies.
Next slide, please.
At this point, it was brought
forward
by Dr. Eric Smith
through our discussions,
and he thought that early
phase clinical trials
would be very important.
An example of this is by a study
led by Dr. Joanna Wardlaw.
Their goal was to see
if they could increase
cerebrovascular function
using a method called CVR,
where there's inhalation
of CO2,
in individuals who had
lacunar ischemic strokes
and if they could increase
cerebrovascular function
over an 8-week period.
And they found that medication
Vascepa, specific medication
did improve
cerebrovascular function,
but what really helped them
is the ability to measure
these early changes
to cerebrovascular function.
So incorporating surrogate
biomarkers
to try and improve function
would be really important.
Next slide.
Finally, coming to our
last recommendation
for human studies,
this was a difficult one
because there are many concepts
that emerge through
this recommendation,
which is that we have
a lot of observational data,
observation study-led data,
but we need to bring back
the idea
that we need to study life
course in diverse population,
and we really need
to consider the fact
that VCID is complex and broad.
There's several dementia-related
risk factors
as well as several biomarkers
of neurodegeneration
that can be leveraged
to try and understand,
how does VCID emerge
and change over the life span.
And this recommendation
on the next slide
could be used in
the context of hypertension.
This is an example how you would
go about a life span approach.
Let's say you're
studying hypertension.
You could collaborate across
individuals and scientists
who are studying systemic
health and brain health,
study extracranial vessel
as well as intercranial health,
and try to map out
how the disease is progressing,
how the changes fold in the body
as well as the brain
are progressing,
and that could really help us
design and feedback
into better interventions
in the future.
On the next slide,
there's a slide
from Dr. Tim Hughes
from the MESA study,
and this slide beautifully
makes the point
that there are
complex pathways involved.
There are upstream vascular
measures
that influence the imaging
measurements that we make,
and they also
impact neuropsychology
outcomes that we measure.
So how do we go about modeling
these complex pathways?
How do we leverage the methods
that we have so far,
and how do we design studies
that can better study
the evolution of VCID changes?
That would be really important
as we go forward.
On the last slide, I'd like to
close on some of the thoughts
that we had about study design.
The group thought that we should
really focus on rigor
and reproducibility
of our results,
consider heterogeneity of VCID
in all our studies,
as well as improve the
generalizability of the samples
that we are studying
to include diverse population
as well as move more
towards open science
so that the whole field benefits
as such while studying VCID.
With that, I'll stop here
and pass it on
to Dr. Sudha Seshardi.
-Hi, I am Sudha from UT
Health San Antonio,
and again,
it's my honor to present.
Next slide.
On behalf of our working group,
these are my disclaimer
and disclosures.
Next slide.
Focus area three, which
is on translational studies.
As you know, translation
is where we take insights
from basic science,
like Dr. Shih outlined,
and assess their applicability
in the design of human trials,
targeting prevention or
treatment of dementia and MCI,
so that was
our recommendation seven.
And recommendation eight
was conversely to look
at associations,
hypotheses that we can generate
based on the large
community-based diverse
human studies,
that Dr. Vemuri outlined,
and see are these
associations valid?
What is the biology
underlying these associations?
So there is a large amount
of biospecimens,
genetic, biometric imaging,
longitudinal data
in human studies,
but only if we understand
the biology of these markers,
whether it's NfL
or something else,
can we apply them
appropriately.
So this reciprocal flow of
information
between basic science studies
and human studies
is key to rapidly
advancing our understanding
and to more successful trials
and interventions.
I'd like to highlight this,
you know,
explain what the rationale
for our working group
was to make
these recommendations
using about five examples.
Next slide.
One of these is something
you've heard about.
In 2012 in science,
there was this exciting
finding that the glymphatic
system of the brain
and the perivascular,
the paravertebral
and the paravenus pathways
were --
had a role in clearing
in substances,
including amyloid,
and at least in mice
as you can see from that graph,
where the green line
is the amount of CSF tracer
on the y-axis removed
during sleep
and the orange line
during the wake state.
Sleep seemed to be
more important
in removing these agents,
these molecules.
Simultaneously, in human studies
that put together observations
on MRI,
observations
whose significance
we were earlier less clear of
with neuropathology,
it was seen that these
in perivascular spaces
corresponded with what was seen
on pathology as enlarged spaces,
and they were greater
in number in conditions
where we would experience
the protein clearance
to be poor,
like in Alzheimer's.
So here, you had a pathology
in animals
correlating with a highly
valued outcome in humans,
which is clearance of
the amyloid, and next slide.
How could this be incorporated
in clinical trials?
Clearly, we want
clinical trials
looking at these modifiable
vascular and metabolic factors,
so can we use
what we have learned in animals?
In animal studies, as you see
in the panels below on the left,
B is obese mice,
and A is control mice.
And you can see these
enlarged perivascular spaces
on the animal MRI are more
abundant in the obese mice.
The next panel shows, in yellow,
the CSF spaces in control rats
on your left
and aging spontaneously
hypertensive rats on the right,
again showing larger spaces.
So if perhaps in humans as well,
the impact --
the adverse impact
of vascular risk factors
on brain cognition and dementia
is partly mediated
through glymphatic function,
and MRI enlarged
perivascular spaces
are a marker
of this glymphatic function,
we can then assess the success
of the vascular intervention
using the specific biomarker.
And going back to
animal studies,
you can understand better
why this may be so.
Next slide.
Some of the unanswered questions
are,
how important is this pathway
for amyloid clearance
in the common
Alzheimer's disease?
How is it modified
by coexisting VCID?
In humans, how important
is sleep and stage of sleep?
And of course, how well do these
enlarged perivascular spaces,
which after all are a static,
structural finding on the MRI,
how does the volume or location
of this ePVS reflect
glymphatic clearance?
Would it be better if we had
a more functional,
real-time MRI biomarker
for glymphatic clearance,
and how might we develop that?
Next.
As Dr. Shih alluded,
one way of developing
a human-based technique
for assessing clearance may be
looking at animal studies.
Next.
Professor Van Nostrand,
who is in this panel,
and others showed in a rat model
of cerebral amyloid angiopathy
that the movement
of biomolecules across the brain
and into the neck vessels
could be seen
using dynamic MRI imaging,
and our group felt
that developing powerful
techniques in humans
could be very valuable.
Next slide.
We know that cerebral
amyloid angiopathy,
one of the VCID types
that is seen in people
with Alzheimer's
appears to be a risk factor
for what is called ARIA,
or amyloid-related
imaging abnormalities.
This is an area
of great interest now
when the FDA and Medicare
are assessing
the risk-benefit ratio
of amyloid lowering therapies.
One of these risks, of course,
is this edema that you see
in the left two MRI panels
as those white changes
or the hemorrhages that you see
in the right two MRI panels
as small black dots.
The fact that coexisting VCID
increases the risk
is also an opportunity for
mitigating therapies that could,
perhaps, be coadministered
with amyloid-lowering agents.
There also seems to be
an individual propensity
to develop
these side effects.
The study showed that
if you were an E4 carrier,
you had three times the risk
as if you were not an E4 carrier
of developing
this type of ARIA edema.
Next.
How does APOE actually increase
the risk of ARIA, E4?
Is it only because E4
is associated
with the greater prevalence
of cerebral amyloid angiopathy?
What is the mechanism
of the ARIA
developing in cerebral amyloid
angiopathy?
You know, in humans,
we have imaging or blood or CSF
and then pathology,
but in animals, you can look
at the different stages.
So clearly, next slide,
we need better models
of cerebral amyloid
angiopathy and ARIA,
and we need them now.
One of the reasons we did
no suspect ARIA in human studies
is because it is not
very common in mice,
so we need other models.
Another question is that
in human studies,
the ARIA develops.
You stop the agent, the MRI
apparently returns to normal,
but people want to know,
is there any lasting,
long-term injury
or side effects?
And one larger animal model,
as Dr. Shih referred to,
is the squirrel monkey.
These are genetically
predisposed to accumulate
amyloid
along their blood vessels,
so a CAA model.
And as these monkeys age,
they develop ARIA-E-like
changes on MRI,
like you can see in the left
panel with those white areas,
as well as ARIA-H-like changes,
as you can see with the white
arrows in the middle panel.
And when these monkeys die,
if you look at the brain,
the regions that had ARIA-E
have this changes in the myelin
and structure injury,
raising concern that ARIA-E,
even if it reverses,
might leave residual cognitive
or functional deficits.
Next.
To go to another example,
you heard about the SPRINT
MIND study
that showed that intensive
control of blood pressure
to 120 millimeters mercury
reduced white matter
hyperintensity accumulation
compared to more standard
blood pressure control to 140,
but white matter hyperintensity
is something
that accrues over time.
Can we use a more
sensitive measure
that reflects
functional changes?
And one that was discussed
was cerebrovascular reactivity.
What is this?
Next slide.
This is something that was also
initially developed in mice,
like transgenic mice
having Swedish,
Dutch and Iowa mutations.
When the concentration of carbon
dioxide is slightly increased,
there is a real-time response
of vasodilation
and increased blood flow.
In the MarkVCID study,
Dr. Hanzhang Lu at Hopkins
has led the standardization and
application of these to humans,
and so this could be applied
in a study
not just like SPRINT or ADNI,
but even something like
an FTD study.
And this change in flow is seen
with just an MRI BOLD.
Next slide.
Conversely, speaking about
looking at data
accrued in population studies,
what can that tell us that could
then be taken to animal studies?
In the CHARGE Consortium
in about 50,000 people,
white matter hyperintensity,
a large GWAS,
we found about 27 loci.
During a transcriptome-wide
association study,
there were about 39 genes
at these 27 loci,
four of them encoding
for drugable targets.
Interestingly, these genes
were also associated
with white matter integrity
measured in a sensitive measure,
diffusion tensor
imaging measure,
in nearly 2,000 young adults,
who were college students,
completely healthy.
And Mendelian randomization
using this composite score
suggested that white
matter hyperintensity volume
was associated
with subsequent
risk of cognitive decline,
dementia and ADRD.
So if these risk variances
are acting across the life span,
there is an opportunity
here for prevention,
but we need to understand their
function through animal studies.
Next slide.
Another example of using animal
studies to understand biology
and develop human biomarkers
to understand the specific role
of individual cell types,
like the cell types
in the blood-brain barrier,
is work from [Indistinct] lab.
The parasite is part
of the blood-brain barrier,
and in mice that have
the APP mutation
that gives them a propensity
to accumulate beta amyloid.
If you also partially knock
out parasites
so that they have
dysfunctional parasites,
you can see, in the second panel
on the right,
amyloid accrues even faster.
So this was then extended to
humans by measuring this marker,
platelet-derived growth factor
receptor-beta,
which is expressed on
the surface of the parasites.
Next.
And you can see that levels
of PDFGR beta
and the CSF are higher
with worse cognition,
a Clinical Dementia
Rating scale score of 0.501
is associated
with higher levels,
suggesting that here
we have a biomarker for parasite
to add to biomarkers
like YKL-40 and NfL,
which are for glia
and neurons.
Next.
The gut-brain axis is emerging
as another important factor
in many neurological disorders,
and there's a fascinating animal
example that showed us this.
In mice, next,
that have a KRIT1 mutation,
there is these development
of the cerebral
cavernous malformations,
just like
the ones humans have.
This KRIT1 gene is associated
with CCM in humans,
but if you deliver the mice
aseptically through
Cesarean section
and have them foster
by germ-free mothers,
you can see
the eight panels below.
Most of those nice developed
the cavernous malformations.
Could this have relevance
for humans?
Next slide.
In fact, humans who are
genetically predisposed
to higher levels
of inflammatory factors,
like TLR4 or CB14,
were more likely to have
larger number of cavernous
malformations in the brain
when they carried
a KRIT1 mutation.
Next.
And can this be related
to their microbiome?
In fact, a recent study showed
that the fetal microbiota
are different.
There are those three phyla
in green
that differed between people
with cerebral cavernous angiomas
and people without
cavernous angiomas.
So here, you have a gene
environment interaction,
an environmental modification
that could really improve
the clinical picture
in these patients.
Next.
A final example comes from
an overlap, next slide,
of a gene TREM2
discovered about a decade ago
to be associated
with risk of AD.
This gene, next, is known to be
expressed not in neurons,
but microglia and to play a role
in clearance of substances.
And if you have a TREM2
knockout,
then a stroke in the mouse model
results in
a larger infarc, and TREM2
is expressed around vessels.
Next.
So we are learning something
about this gene,
about this marker.
Soluble TREM2 was found to be
a potential marker
of cerebrovascular disease
in neurodegenerative disorders
in some persons
with hemorrhagic stroke,
who had either
small vessel disease
because of CAA or small vessel
disease because of hypertension.
Higher levels of TREM2
were associated
with greater
white matter hyperintensity,
and this was also true
as shown in a paper in "Brain."
When you looked at people
who had tau pathology
in the brain,
the red circles
are people with AD,
and they had higher levels
of soluble TREM2.
But soluble TREM2
may not be all bad.
The levels vary over time.
And if you looked at people
with AD, amyloid positive,
tau positive, higher levels
of soluble TREM2
in the plasma
were actually associated
with better MMSE scores,
so you see the importance
of understanding
something that we have
identified as a biomarker
based on
just genetic association.
So these were some of the
reasons for the strong
push on recommendation
seven and eight,
and I look forward to further
feedback and discussions.
Thank you.
Handing back to Donna.
-Maybe I'll jump in here,
Ron Petersen.
Thanks very much, Sudha,
for that wonderful,
kind of tying
everything together.
And I'd like to thank Andy
and Prashanthi
also for summarizing the work
of the three work groups
and very, very nicely.
I think it's been
an exciting time
to discuss the possibilities,
and as Prashanthi outlined,
there has been significant
movement in this area
funded by NIH
since the 2019 summit.
MarkVCID, DISCOVERY,
DiverseVCID on the human side
have all been launched,
and we've had numerous
animal model studies.
So again, Andy nicely outlined
where we are with regard
to the modeling of VCID,
and he pointed out,
Prashanthi pointed out,
Sudha pointed out the
complexity of VCID disorders,
that is the heterogeneity
of them.
So not only does VCID exist
in a heterogeneous environment
in the aging human
with amyloid,
tau, alpha-synuclein, TDP-43,
but within VCID itself,
it is heterogeneous,
multifactorial.
That's the tough news.
The good news is that
May addressed
some therapeutic options.
Each of those different
mechanisms that Andy outlined
could potentially be
amenable to intervention,
so I think the pathologic
diversity is encouraging,
and I think what he outlined
was an approach using genetics,
lifestyle modifications,
looking at age, looking at sex,
taking into account
the VCID-AD interactions
that are likely in many,
many situations,
but I think this does give us
the opportunity to move forward.
The basic group also focused
on the neurovascular unit,
so both single-cell,
cell-specific technologies
are being developed,
looking at
neurovascular coupling,
blood-brain barrier integrity,
clearance of toxic proteins
as Sudha outlined
and the aging
process itself.
Aging on top of this.
Why is it that aging is --
How is aging contributing
to the increase
in vascular disease
as we go forward?
The experimental models then,
learning from
cardiovascular disease,
cerebrovascular disease,
their impact on myelin white
matter and neurodegeneration
are all becoming more apparent
as these studies continue.
The human studies group
also looked
at the diversity of the disease
and, as Prashanthi indicated,
really focused on biomarkers
because biomarker says --
We're hearing
throughout this meeting.
We'll hear it tomorrow.
Biomarkers are really key
at trying
to separate out
the individual components
of these various pathologies,
so I think that the group
focused on the fact
that these tools need
to be evaluated
in diverse communities.
Among all the ADRDs that we'll
be discussed today and tomorrow,
perhaps VCID is among
the most important with regard
to understanding
in diverse communities
because of increased prevalence
of some of the cardiovascular
and cerebrovascular
comorbidities,
so VCID is really in
the crosshairs of this exercise,
and I think the group
certainly was aware of that
and focused many
of the recommendations
in that direction.
So certainly standardizing
evaluations,
assessments, behavioral,
functional, noninvasive,
using some of the digital tools
that are emerging now
will allow us to evaluate
a variety of populations,
again, looking at heterogeneity
and focusing also
on fluid biomarkers,
exosomes and what
they will tell us
about the underlying pathology.
Getting into interventions,
we can talk then
about either pharmacologic
or lifestyle modifications.
Lifestyle for vascular disease
right now are very important,
and we really need
to be concerned.
This morning, we had heard
about the strategy
of possibly oversampling
underrepresented groups.
Maybe that is the strategy
that we use --
need to use here in VCID
studies as well.
Of course, harmonization
of data is critical.
The combination of risk factors
throughout the life course,
as both Prashanthi
and Sudha mentioned,
is increasingly important
because we know
that these diseases
don't develop overnight.
The pathology evolves
over many, many years.
So we need to look
at a life-course projection
not only with age
but with sex, complex pathways.
But interestingly, the other
side of the coin is --
Involves resilience.
That is, there are people
who have these various
risk factors who do just fine,
and so while we do this in
the Alzheimer's disease space,
we need to do it
in the vascular space as well.
And then Sudha very nicely
put this together.
What are learning
from the animal models,
and how in fact
are we going to apply it
from the animal models
to the human model?
So again, I want to thank
the entire committee.
If the committee could turn
on their cameras,
I please would offer them
the opportunity to comment
on any of the questions
that are out there,
and I think we have -- see some
that are posting already,
so let me start
with Steve Greenberg.
Steve?
-Hey.
Really great to see everybody,
and I know I'm speaking
for a big audience here to say
those were just spectacular
overviews of the field,
and the talks were great,
and the field is great.
I mean, it's really
an exciting time.
I'm just going to pick up
on one thread that came up.
The cross-link between vascular
and neurodegenerative disease
came up in --
as a recommendation priority
item in multiple sections,
and really just to continue
the line of sights
that Sudha showed,
you know, of all the different
postulated mechanisms
for the interaction
between the vascular system
and neurodegenerative,
probably the one
that's most well substantiated
is the role
of vascular disease
in affecting
cardiovascular clearance
in the lymphatic system.
That seems to be
a really striking area,
kind of nexus between
the two processes,
and it fits into
really well --
It fits very well
with what we understand
about amyloid clearance,
and amyloid is an extracellular,
sort of interstitial
fluid peptide
that needs to be cleared,
and if the clearance system
is mucked up,
that's going to
increase deposition.
You know, more broadly speaking,
it's hard to believe
that clearance of the fluid
in the interstitial space
isn't a much broader
mechanism in disease,
so even outside
of the amyloid context,
which maybe, you know,
maybe is the most important one
from a disease standpoint,
you know, it's hard to believe
that there aren't other disease
processes that are affected
by having stuff that does
or doesn't get cleared out
of the interstitial fluid
and especially
with the number of ADRDs
and ther disease that are driven
by protein deposits.
Not all of them have
this prominent
extracellular phase
that amyloid does,
but all of them have some
sort of extracellular phase,
and, you know,
one of the advantages
of having an ADRD summit
is the chance to do
what we don't do very often,
which is getting together
as an ADRD community
and thinking in
a very cross-disciplinary way.
So the question if we could all
sit in the same room together
or at least virtually would be,
you know, broadly speaking,
what else do we think that loss
of perivascular clearance
might be doing to promote
neurodegenerative disease,
and how would that translate
into either biomarkers?
And Sudha brought up the,
you know,
the high position
of lymphatic markers
on our wish list
for biomarkers
but how it might move
into trials,
so anyway,
it's a broad question,
and it's hard, again,
hard to believe
it isn't playing a role
in a lot of disease states.
-Absolutely, Steve.
Thanks very much.
Comments?
Sudha, other folks on the panel,
comments for Steve?
-Completely agree that
it probably plays a role.
Other molecules that might
be involved in the pathway
like [Indistinct]
also potentially valuable
biomarkers completely.
Thank you for bringing this up
and for the pioneering work
that MarkVCID and is doing,
for instance,
to establish these as usable,
pragmatic, biologically
and technologically
validated biomarkers
that can then be extended
the studies
of other neurodegeneration
as well as of
vascular interventions.
-All right.
Thank you.
Couple up.
Prashanthi, you have your hand
up and then Dave.
-Quick point, I think
there's emerging evidence
that it's the same with tau,
so I think studying
the changes locally
and globally would be
very important
to move
this concept forward.
-Very good.
Dave?
-In regard to Steve
Greenberg's point,
I think there's a lot
of emerging evidence
from labs
like the Cos Iadecola,
Jony Kipnis' and others
that strongly suggest
that specific cells
that surround blood vessels,
such as perivascular
macrophages,
are really important
in regulating the connection
between interstitial fluid
flow and lymph --
ultimately flow out
through the lymphatic system,
so I think that those could
easily affect not just amyloid
but lots of other functions,
such as blood-vessel function,
so I think that's an area that
really needs a lot more study.
-Yeah, rich area of study.
Speaking of Cos Iadecola,
Cos, I have you up next.
-Yeah, I like to make
two points,
so one is that the focus
of the field,
you know, very masterfully,
you know,
described by the speakers
has been of vascular failure
being linked to starvation of
the brain of oxygen and glucose.
I think now,
as Dave pointed out,
the clearance of the blood
vessels is now becoming
another potential
pathogenic mechanism.
The blood-brain barrier
has emerged
as a pathogenic mechanism,
all right, which are independent
of the delivery of oxygen
and glucose to the brain,
which has been
traditionally considered
the basis
of vascular injury.
All right?
But the brain, I mean,
the vessels of the brain
do more than that.
They deliver growth factors
to the neurons,
and that's been very well
described in development.
And for example, even
in neurogenesis in adult animals
where the vessels
deliver vital factors,
including nitric oxide,
that keeps the neurogenic
niche alive.
The recent paper in neuron
shows that [Indistinct]
of the blood vessels
in hippocampus
is vital for maintaining
the neurogenic niche.
For example,
the other [Indistinct]
suggests that, you know,
[Indistinct]
from the endothelial
is required to maintain
tau homeostasis in neurons.
All right?
So there is a new area
out there,
and I think that that is
very ripe for [Indistinct]
that will explore
nonischemia-related aspect
of vascular function
which are ever
very important role
in the maintenance
of brain health.
All right?
That's really --
The other point I want to make
is that,
you know, the diversity
of the brain in VCID
combines with the diversity
of the mechanism of VCID.
Now this proposes a number
of issues or problems
that we need to address.
One is that there is a diversity
of cell types in the brain,
so anything that you do in vitro
we used to do with cultured
and endothelial cells.
Now we know there are
eight kinds
of endothelial cells in a brain.
They all look the same.
They have completely different
transcriptomic profiles.
So what kind of cells are we
going to use organoids, right?
What kind of, you know,
what kind of parasite
are we going to use?
There are now three classes
of parasites in humans.
What kinds of smooth muscle
cells are you going to use?
So that's a level of complexity.
The other level of complexity
is regional complexity.
White-matter regulation
of blood flow
is different than cortical
regulation of blood flow,
which has been one
traditionally studied
because it's there easily for us
to drill a hole in the head
and look at the cortex.
All right?
But what about, you know,
the cerebellum has a completely
different vascular regulation
than the cortex does?
Nitrous oxide being responsible
for 100 percent
on [Indistinct]
whereas, in the cortex,
it's only 50, 60 percent,
so there is
regional complexity.
And finally there is
a mechanistic complexity.
I've heard, you know, both,
you know,
Prashanth and Sudha mention,
you know, CO2 reactivity.
That's only one aspect
of vascular regulation.
The mechanism of which
are completely different
from neurovascular coupling,
for example,
or endothelial function,
so if you study CO2 reactivity
and it's normal,
doesn't mean that the vessels of
the brain are working normally
because, you know,
the endothelial may be failing.
You know, CO2 is multifactorial
in the brain,
depends on number of factors
coming from every single cells
in the brain.
So we need to kind of also
be aware of that,
and I grant you that is
very difficult to study,
you know, neurovascular
coupling versus
to get the guy
to breathe CO2.
All right?
It's very easy to do that.
That's why people do it.
All right?
We got to start somewhere,
and I'm all, you know,
in support of that,
but I believe that, you know,
we need to kind of be,
you know,
much more nuanced approach
when we start to translate
these findings to the humans,
and thank you for allowing me
to express my thoughts on this.
-Well, thanks very much, Cos,
for simplifying
the whole situation,
making it pretty
straightforward.
But, Sudha, please comment.
-Just wanted to --
Cos, you're obviously
a leader in the field,
always on the cutting edge,
and couldn't agree more.
Some of the emerging imaging
technologies like the 7-Tesla
imaging that may show the
hippocamp or microvasculature
to a greater extent,
things like C11-FDP PET,
which we are employing
in a study of rapamycin funded,
you know, where we can see
different aspects of blood flow
and things like correlating
the postmortem MRI
with the kind of [Indistinct]
study that Andy Shih showed
where you can actually look
at single-cell omics
and different perhaps
regions of the brain.
Yes, it seems like increasing
complexity
seems inevitable before
we arrive at simplicity,
but at least
the attention to VCID
is very exciting as a key factor
in all of ADRD.
-Okay.
Thanks.
Let's -- In the interest
of getting to
as many individuals as we can,
let's turn to Charlie.
Charlie, your thoughts?
-Thank you, and first,
I want to say
this is so exciting
having been in this field
for such a long time to see how
new innovation is going,
and I just want to say
shout-out to Dr. Corriveau
for leading this charge and
supporting this through NINDS.
I'm very, very grateful.
My point and question is,
how do we tie this together?
And my feeling is that vascular
cognitive impairment
is a systemic disease.
It involves the endothelial.
It involves vascular remodeling,
and it involves disruption
of the blood-brain barrier,
or subtle dysfunction
might be a better word.
And I think it's rife,
or the opportunity exists
to look at that interaction
through cell-cell communication.
Right now, we're looking
at some exosome signaling,
but it could be
circulating factors
and new data
that's coming out suggesting
that, you know,
placental growth factor
may be important,
but inflammation --
And my point here
is that a broader view
as it's been alluded
to that combines animal models
with human health injury
and teases apart
how the system itself
is affecting the brain,
and I think that
that emphasis is important,
and I'd love to hear
thoughts on that.
-Thanks, Charlie.
Comments for him?
Eric, what do you think?
Charlie on target here?
-Yeah, I didn't raise my hand
because I agree
with Charlie's point.
I think of putting it
all together.
I raised my hand and lowered it
before too
because Sudha made a point,
which is that the extent
that we can also drive
human biomarkers
of these processes
to help us link,
you know, how the complexity
is being unraveled
in the basic science lab
and translate it
to human studies
and then use those as targets
for early phase
therapeutic trials,
I think, is something
the field has to be considering.
Thank you.
-Very good.
Thanks, Eric.
Okay.
Alexandria Early or Alexandria
Linton, comments?
-Recent name change.
I just wanted to start by saying
thank you so much
to all of the speakers for
a very clear and engaging talk.
Dr. Vemuri, you made a great
point in your conclusion slide
about prioritizing rigor
and reproducibility,
but I wanted to actually bring
that point back
to Dr. Shih's section.
So, Dr. Shih, you showcased
many innovative methods
in your section,
but as a trainee
studying in this area,
I was wondering how
the committee plans to address
or prioritize the repeatability
and reproducibility problem
that we've encountered
as these techniques
and these methods tend to evolve
and advance so quickly,
especially in light
of the heterogeneity
that we recently discussed.
Thank you.
-Thank you.
Let me throw that to Rema Raman.
Rema, you've been the one
who've been pushing us
on the rigor
and reproducibility.
Comments?
-Yeah, that's a great point,
Alexandria.
I think it's something that
we should all be cognizant of
as we develop experimental to
make sure that the designs --
It's a discussion that's had
at the design stage,
the training of scientists
who are [Indistinct]
clinical research, you know,
so sort of addressing
it across the board
starting with training,
focus on experimental design,
focus on data collection,
focus on data quality
that would then --
and then open science,
sharing these results,
making sure that everything
is shared at the global level
so that studies
can be reproduced,
and so taking that
comprehensive view
around the need for rigor
and reproducibility
right from the start
all the way through the end
and open sharing sort of
will help us get there,
and that's some
of the discussions
we've been having as
part of this discussion.
-Very good.
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Rema.
Okay.
Let me turn to
Atticus Hainsworth.
Question, comments?
-I thank you very much.
Great to be part of this.
Atticus Hainsworth
dialing in from London, UK.
Great to hear about all these
fantastic new biomarkers,
new models, new targets.
My question is, what do you rate
as the chances
of attracting
the drug companies
back into the space
of brain vascular disease,
and is it something
you even would want to do?
-Excellent question,
excellent question.
There's been a migration away
over the years.
Let me --
Maybe let me throw --
You're not
paying attention, Natalia,
but I'm going to
throw this one to you.
What do you think about bringing
the pharmaceutical industry
back into the business here?
-Well, I think
it's already happening, right?
So there's already
some interest and...
-Are you freezing?
-I think she's frozen.
-You may have frozen there,
Natalia.
We'll let you unfreeze.
Donna, you have a comment.
Natalia is back?
-No, I apologize.
I'm sure -- I'm sorry.
This says, "Zoom quit" --
Oh, no.
-It did that to me
over our lunch break, Natalia.
You're just going to have
to sign off, come back in.
-Okay.
-So, I mean...
-Donna.
-...I'll just
give my two cents.
You know, I think we have
to at some point
get the drug companies back in.
I don't think this is something
we can solve...
-I'm --
-...just ourselves.
-Yeah.
Oh.
-That's okay.
But it takes us to find
the targets, and it takes us to,
you know, get to mechanism,
and I think that's where,
Atticus,
we really need
those mechanistic studies,
and, you know,
I think Sudha's presentation
brought it all back together
where we need that backwards
and forwards translation from,
you know,
from our animal models to our,
you know,
our clinical human studies
and then back to the mice
to see,
you know,
what we find in the humans.
What does that
mean mechanistically
when we manipulate
that system?
Then you start looking
at targets, you know,
but there's got to be
a back and forth,
and for me, I think we need
a metal, you know, mammal.
You know, mouse-to-human
translation
has not served as well today
in the dementia field
as a whole.
So...
-Thank you.
Eric, you have your hand up?
-Yeah, sure, no,
I think Natalia is right.
There does seem to be
some beginning glimmers
of interest in this space.
There has not been a lot
of commercial interest
in clinical trials
in therapies for VCID.
I think what's needed are
targets that Donna mentioned,
you know, like innovative
aspects of the biology
of the neurovascular unit
that can be exploited
for a therapeutic benefit
ideally
where genetic modifiers,
the process can be discovered
because I think they put
a lot of stock in
Mendelian randomization
studies to suggest
that the quantifying target
might improve outcomes,
and we need standardization
of our methods
for clinical trials
in this population too,
and I think MarkVCID, you know,
has given a package
of biomarkers that can be used,
but it's also standardization,
the clinical assessment
on definition
of who has the disease and how
to measure it on outcomes,
not only cognitive but
also behavioral and functional.
I'm part of a group
called Finesse.
Some others on this call
are part of this too led
by Hugh Markus
and Martin Dichgans
to try to provide
some consensus around,
you know, how a trial
for VCID should be run.
That hopefully will give
companies more confidence
that we have achieved
the ability to run a trial
with high-quality,
standardized methods.
Thanks.
-Very good.
Thank you.
Steve, you had some comments?
-Just going to add that
although we always want
a better
mechanistic understanding,
we certainly want it
for small vessel disease.
I don't think we have a shortage
of rational targets.
The issue that, you know,
everyone on this call is aware
is that VCID is in
a different position from --
certainly from the FTD or LBD
in that it's a highly
prevalent pathology.
Almost everybody has it,
and it almost never is the sole
cause of cognitive impairment.
It almost always coexists
with other pathologies.
So for a highly prevalent,
you know,
modestly contributing pathology,
but the overall attributable
risk is extremely high
because it's so prevalent,
so we need biomarkers
that can live in a world
where small vessel disease
or other vascular pathologies
are coexisting with
neurodegenerative pathologies
and that we're able
to not use that
as a reason not to do trials
but as a reason to say,
"Okay. We need biomarkers
that can at least help select
out the vascular contribution
and then make that
the focus of a trial,"
so I think that that's a concept
that's a little harder
for drug companies
to get their teeth around
where they're used to saying,
"Okay. You've got this disease,
and we're going to give you
this therapy for this disease.
The mixed world is messier,
but it's also the real world,
and it's certainly
a big unmet need,
so, you know, it's a little
self-serving of me to say,
"Biomarkers are important,"
but I think that's
going to be the key
to getting the companies back.
-I think so too [Indistinct].
Gareth.
-Yeah, and I think this is
what Andy mentioned in his talk,
which is we have
a panel of models,
but they're not
particularly well defined
in terms of what they show
and when and in what order,
and so when companies would look
to the preclinical studies,
it's hard for them to, you know,
design the next step,
either preclinical
or even clinical studies,
and so first step, I think,
would be to better define
what it is that the models
actually recapitulate
and also then make the call
as to whether those models
and the panel of models
is sufficient,
which then means
we would then need to go back
and generate better models
that better recreate
particularly the heterogeneity
of this pretty complex disease.
-Very good.
Thank you.
Rod?
-Thanks, yeah, I just want
to build a bit agreeing
with Steve and just --
and say it in a slightly --
or add to it, and that is that
if we're thinking about,
you know, if we think about VCID
and you think about, you know,
who will be involved
in the clinical trials,
biomarkers
are absolutely critical.
It's also critical for companies
and actually individuals
to recognize
and be able to embrace
that concept,
and right now those companies
and individuals
for the most part are looking
at clinical Alzheimer's disease.
That's the biggest space
for VCID clinical trials,
clinical Alzheimer's disease,
and connecting those things,
you know,
in terms of molecular mechanisms
and with biomarkers
also just with the light bulb
going off and everyone say,
"Oh, my goodness, yes,
I have clinical Alzheimer's.
I'm going to enroll
in a clinical trial for VCID,"
from my perspective
is part of the challenge
that this field faces.
-Very good.
Keith is giving us
5 additional clinics.
There are a couple
of questions left.
Dave, you got a quick comment?
-Just a quick comment
about the --
developing drugs for VCID,
I think,
as in Alzheimer's disease,
I think the biggest success
is going to be prevention
or secondary prevention.
Certainly we know from studies
like the mind --
SPRINT MIND
trial,
that, you know,
just decreasing blood pressure
has a big effect
on decreasing mild
cognitive impairment incidents,
so that means that other things
probably could have a big effect
if you study them before,
you know, manifestations
were too severe,
and that means biomarkers,
whether it's current ones
or other ones,
to identify
preclinical disease
are probably going to be
really super important.
-Very good.
Okay.
Natasha, you're --
Natalia, you're back?
-I'm back.
I'm really sorry.
That's what happens
when you're, you know,
you're absorbing
that Wi-Fi so intensely.
It just crashes when you finally
get an opportunity to speak.
I just wanted to say, and I
missed most of the discussion
on that
while I was reconnecting,
but I wanted to say
there is also --
While we are in this process,
we are also learning something
by some of the trials
that I feel will be coming in
with repurposing of the drugs.
You know, there is a lot
of interest in drug makers
right now to try out some of
the anti-inflammatory therapy,
some of the more targeted.
Some, you know,
some are less targeted,
but they're trying to also
widen stroke space
and, you know, and --
by extension and VCID.
So we will learn
something from it.
Maybe some of the, you know,
so to speak,
translation into clinical models
is not as perfect as we would,
you know, would've, you know,
wanted it to be,
but we will gain
some knowledge from that,
and I think that's going to be,
you know, just contributing
to accumulating a base
of knowledge in that space.
-Okay.
Thank you.
Let me do one more,
and Niccolo has been
standing by for some time,
and I want to get to him.
And the other couple
of questions we'll get to,
I think, later off-line.
I appreciate your patience.
But Niccolo Terrando.
-Thank you very much first
of all to the whole panel.
This was very informative,
great talks.
Fairly hard question
for a last minute, I guess,
but it was very intriguing,
the role of vascular dysfunction
in the neuroinflammatory
processes,
so I'm wondering if there are
some kind of recommendation
or just general thoughts in
terms of causality in the system
and whether this [Indistinct]
as the systemic dysfunction
might actually be
a CNS-originated problem
that then impacts the vascular
[Indistinct]
from inside out to some extent,
so I'm just wondering if there
are some thoughts on this,
and thank you very much.
-Comments, responses
from the group?
-I can speak
of that a little bit.
I think that's a fantastic
question, and it's true.
You know, even
the vascular-based
defects like
the blood-brain barrier
will lead to neuroinflammation,
but then the neuroinflammatory
reactions
irrespective of the vasculature
can then work backward
and act on the vessels so,
you know,
chicken-and-egg problem,
and I think that the --
some of the studies
that we have we want to,
we want to do
to better understand
the etiology of the disease
to go back
and see which came first
to go much earlier,
can help to address some of
those types of questions,
to see which --
You know, if we could measure
both the neuroinflammation
and the vascular defects
at the same time,
one probably emerges
before the other.
Maybe it's too intermixed for us
to ever dissociate properly,
but then maybe that's
where genetic approaches
that allow us to target
the vessels independently
or the parenchymal
cell types independently
and then tease apart
that complexity.
-Very good, thank you.
I think, Keith, we probably
have to wrap up
so we don't steal too much
of the break time here
and intrude
on the next session, so --
but let me draw a line here
and say thank you
to all the panelists,
especially the speakers today,
Andy, Prashanthi,
Sudha, my cochair,
Donna,
and I want to thank
Dr. Koroshetz, Dr. Corriveau
for putting all this together,
Keith for organizing it,
and I think we'll take
a break now, Keith.
Is that right?
-Yeah, for a few minutes.
We'll be back at 3:40 p.m.
Eastern.
-Welcome back for our
last session of the day
dedicated
to Lewy body dementias,
and it's my pleasure
to introduce to you session
cochairs Dr. Kejal Kantarci
and James Leverenz.
Welcome.
-Thank you, Natalia.
It's my pleasure
with my cochair,
Dr. Jim Leverenz,
that we would like
to welcome you
to the Lewy Body
Dementia session.
Lewy Body Dementia includes
both dementia with Lewy Bodies
and Parkinson's Disease
dementia.
And if you go to the next
slide, right, that's good.
I would like to acknowledge
my colleagues
who have contributed
to the draft recommendations
on the Lewy Body Dementia
topic.
They are from
academic institutions
as well as industry.
I would also like to acknowledge
our advisors,
Dr. Babcock from NINDS,
Dr. Masliah from NIA
and Angela Taylor from Lewy Body
Dementia Association.
We have four talks
in this session.
Two are focused on
clinical characterization
and information,
and the other two
are on pathogenesis
and mechanisms of toxicity.
Now, if we go to the next slide,
I will now hand it over
to my cochair,
Dr. Jim Leverenz,
from Cleveland Clinic,
who will talk about
the recommendations
on clinical trials
and study cohorts.
-Thank you, Kejal.
Now, I want to thank
the theme members for your --
Brad Boeve, Jesse Cedarbaum,
Doug Galasko and Angela Taylor
from the LBDA.
Next.
My disclaimer, my disclosure,
I also receive grant support
from the NINDS,
NIA, Lewy
Body Dementia Association
[Indistinct] health care.
Next slide.
So we're going to go back
to 2019
and look at two of the
priorities, number one and two,
and review what
we've seen so far
and where we want
to go from here.
So this includes
the clinical trials,
priority one, recommendation
one and recommendation two,
priority two,
the longitudinal antimortem
LBDA characterization.
Next.
So first recommendation,
number one and priority one,
was, prepare for
and initiate clinical trials
that aim to alleviate
or slow the course
of Lewy Body
Dementia symptoms,
delay or prevent
the onset of disease.
Next slide.
Actually, it was
a very active area,
and over the last,
what, 3 years now,
there have been five
pharmaceutical trials
complete at
the different phases,
phase one, two and three,
and there are actually
quite a number
of currently active trials,
both pharma-based,
NIA-funded-based
and some nonpharmaceutical
interventions, as well.
Next slide.
Really a wide range
of mechanisms of action, again,
with the idea
of treating either symptoms
or actually addressing
disease modification.
I'm not going to go through
each one on this list here.
But again, many of these
are still active,
so this has been a very active
area of research and success.
Next slide.
So one thing that
we've been looking for
is to develop better clinical
trials for the LBD area.
One is to include biomarkers.
We've been hearing a lot
about biomarkers today,
and we'll hear many more
in the subsequent session,
though particularly around
the idea of addressing issues
both of Lewy Body Dementia
accurate diagnosis
as well as the fact
that we do have lots of patients
with mixed disease,
particularly coexistent
Alzheimer's disease.
Lots of discussion,
as well, around, do we --
When should we be using,
for example,
amyloid therapies
in the LBDA arena?
Also, progress in the area
of making several working groups
with different programs
focused on developing better
study protocols and design
that are more specifically
linked to Lewy Body Dementia.
Next slide.
So recommend one still remains,
and priority number one,
prepare for and initiate
clinical trials
that aim to alleviate or slow
the course of LBD symptoms,
slow disease progression
or prevent onset of disease.
Next slide.
Where are the gaps?
Well, this is
a common theme today,
so clearly diversity
is a big issue here,
and involving more
diverse populations
in the clinical trial arena
is critical.
We also need to
integrate biomarkers
for optimal participant
selection both from a,
"Do they have
Lewy Body disease?"
but also,
"Do they have" --
what other copathologies
they have,
particular
Alzheimer's disease,
and you'll hear more about that
in the biomarkers section.
We do need more
Lewy-Body-Dementia-sensitive
outcome measures.
A lot of studies are based
on Alzheimer's disease
clinical trials.
We do need to promote data
sharing for larger Ns,
novel mechanisms
and actually a pipeline
as we get to recommendations
seven
and eight, pipeline
from discovery to intervention
to also address new,
novel mechanisms.
Next slide.
2019, recommendation number two
was to develop
longitudinal antimortem
Lewy Body Dementia
characterization.
Next slide.
Actually, in that context,
a number of studies
were funded from the NIH
including the NINDS Parkinson's
Disease Biomarker Program.
That funded a number of
Lewy Body Dementia studies.
There also was the REM
sleep behavior disorders cohort,
NAPS and now NAPS2
and actually Lewy Body Dementia
cohorts within the NIAP30
Alzheimer's Center program.
Increasingly involved
are groups like PPMI,
looking at de novo Parkinson's,
prodromal and genetic cohorts,
AMP-PD,
and I think there continues
to be a nice collaboration
and a communication
across US
and European cohorts
on common data elements
and needs usually highlighted
during international meeting.
Next slide.
So what are some of
the key developments?
Parkinson's Disease
Biomarker Program
has led to a nice, broad
Lewy Body Disease focus.
There is a biorepository linked,
the BioSend, Data Management
Resource or DMR
and some Systematic
Assessment of Cohorts
across the Lewy Body
Disease Spectrum, so we can
have comparisons across groups.
Slide.
With the PDBP NINDS UO1 program,
there have been
a number of funded studies,
the Dementia with Lewy
Bodies Consortium
across nine sites, GBA
Pathway from Scherzer,
Lewy Body
Dementia Biomarker program
at Michigan, Longitudinal
Imaging Biomarker program
led or coled by my cochair here,
and the Lewy-Body-Specific
Pathology
Using Biomarkers
at Columbia University.
Next slide.
Just some of the progress
to date,
there are approximately
359 individuals
who participated
across the NINDS
U01 program that are in the DMR,
average age around 70,
a low percentage of women,
which may be partly
the biology of Lewy Body
Disease, a modest amount
of motor Parkinsonism
and, again, a common theme where
we're seeing predominantly
a Caucasian, European,
white population
within this cohort
or these cohorts.
Next slide.
An, again, great resource
from an imaging point of view
combining the Mayo
Imaging-Focused Project
and, again,
I mentioned, Lewy Body
Consortium, we have close to 200
MRIs, 192 CAT scans.
You see amyloid PET and tau PET
to really look at how we discern
these copathologies.
Probably the one weakness so far
is that these programs
are still looking to increase
the longitudinal follow-up
in terms of imaging.
Next slide.
And this also links
into the biofluid,
so really strong
blood-based biofluids
that are available
as well as spinal fluid
and link to the blood,
but we see this diminishing
longitudinal data.
Next slide.
We do have quite a lot
of aliquots
that have been sent
to the program
and I think now at 117,000
including a link to CSF
and blood aliquots,
so this is something
that investigators
will want
to take advantage of.
Next slide.
And finally, there have been
some limited efforts
for autopsies so far,
and that's going to be,
again, a common theme today
to really link this back to the
clinical biomarker development.
Next slide.
All right.
So where are our issues?
Again, coming back to diversity
and particularly
in the African-American
and more other
diverse populations,
the sex difference, we can do,
perhaps, some selection
for more women to participate,
although again,
particularly within the pure
dementia Lewy Bodies
without, actually, coexistent
Alzheimer's, we don't see --
We see a tendency for
a strong male predominance,
which is telling us
something.
We are looking for preclinical
and prodromal cohorts
and, of course, we have
the NAPS program in part
to deal
with this prodromal cohort.
I'd like to see expanded
and optimized
longitudinal characterization
with continued linkage
of biofluid collection
imaging in autopsy.
There are a number of,
I think, exciting new areas,
particularly around
the RT-QuIC/PMCA
and biofluids and tissues.
This is something that really
can solidify the diagnosis
of Lewy Body Disease,
linking that to imaging, digital
and electrophysiologic
techniques.
And again, we'd like to promote
harmonization across cohorts
both in terms of programs
that are already funded
but non-US sites, PPMI,
to allow us
for larger [Indistinct]
studies that we
would like to do.
Next slide.
So we have made and continue
to make clinical trials,
and LBD recommendation number
one and priority number one,
in terms of
the longitudinal follow-up,
we've moved that down
to priority four.
This is an ongoing program,
again.
We want to support
the longitudinal
expansion of these studies,
but this is already
well-developed.
Next slide.
So I'm going to move on
to Dr. Kantarci,
who's going to
discuss biomarkers
in terms of imaging
and biofluids.
Kejal, all yours.
-Thank you, Jim,
for the great introduction.
So I will be talking
about biomarkers,
which will include imaging
biomarkers and biomarkers
utilizing biofluids,
tissues, digital
and electrophysiologic methods.
And I would like to acknowledge
my colleagues,
who have contributed to the
recommendations on biomarkers,
Drs. Vallencourt,
Marder and Galasko.
And if you go to the next slide,
disclosure is listed here.
Next slide.
Biomarker
validation is a stepwise process
that start with the discovery
of the biomarker
with cross-sectional studies
looking into sensitivity,
specificity and accuracy
of the biomarker.
And then in the next step,
it can involve
longitudinal studies
looking at
reliability, repeatability
and reproducibility.
And now that we have
tested the biomarker
in clinically
diagnosed cohorts,
a critical next step
is the validation
in pathologically
diagnosed cohorts.
And finally, the biomarkers
tested in cohorts
enrolled in clinical trials
for patient selection,
target engagement and assessment
of disease modification.
So one of the biomarkers
that have passed
these validation steps
is analog imaging with PET.
And if we go to the next slide.
And it's important to note
that not all biomarkers
may demonstrate excellence
in all of these steps.
And FDA has this comprehensive
classification of biomarkers
based on their performance
for different goals,
as you can see here.
We go to the next slide.
So in 2019, when the
recommendations were written
for Lewy Body Dementia,
the neuroimaging biomarkers
were considered
as the third priority in
the clinical science focus area,
and biomarkers for biofluids,
tissues, digital
and electrophysiologic methods
were considered
as the first priority
in the basic science focus
are because there was
a lot of interest
in development of these
biomarkers as a top priority.
So if we go to the next slide,
in the current draft
recommendations we have,
Lewy Body work group
placed biomarker recommendations
to priority number two
for neuroimaging
and priority number
three for biomarkers
utilizing other tissues,
biofluids and digital methods.
And they were listed under
the clinical characterization
and intervention focus area
because these recommendations
emphasize
applications of biomarkers
that were developed,
so applications
in the clinical research
as the top priority.
Now, if we go the next one,
so the pathogenesis
and disease mechanisms
in Lewy Body Dementia
is complex.
That involves not
only alpha-synuclein
but frequently accompanied
by other proteinopathies
including a beta, tau and TDP-43
as well as vascular disease.
On the right-hand side,
in a study of a large European
and North American
cohort of dementia
with Lewy Bodies cases,
it was demonstrated that
a majority of the cohort
fulfilled
the diagnostic criteria
for dementia
with Lewy Bodies,
had high levels
of amyloid or tau
or had both protein deposits,
and a smaller proportion
did not have high levels.
Therefore, we recommended
utilizing established
and new imaging tools
to determine the evolution
of this multiproteinopathy
in Lewy Body Dementia
including synergistic
interactions of proteins
across brain regions
and across time
in Lewy Body Dementia.
We go to the next slide.
Biomarkers can inform
the temporal progression
and evolution of different
clinical phenotypes
of cognition,
motor, sleep and behavior
in Lewy Body Dementia,
and they can also
inform the clinical
and genetic subgroups
of patients
with rapid versus
slow progression of Parkinson's
Disease dementia versus dementia
with Lewy Bodies,
GBA or alpha-synuclein
mutation carriers
and also inform relative
contribution of alpha-synuclein
and Alzheimer's Disease pathways
and burden
to the clinical phenotype.
Finally, biomarkers are critical
in clinical trials
and can be used for target
engagement and efficacy
and clinical outcomes.
And to answer all of
these questions,
we feel that we need
big data approaches,
and data sharing will be
necessary to integrate
biomarkers and clinical data.
And if we go to the next slide,
there have been several requests
for applications
by the NIH
within the last several years
focused on biomarkers
including the center data,
Centers without Walls for PET
Ligand Development for ADRD,
in particular
for alpha-synuclein,
looking at
the peripheral pathology
in Lewy Body Dementias,
the UO1 biomarkers
for Lewy Body Dementias program
that Jim Leverenz
has mentioned
and also progression markers
of cognitive impairment
in Parkinson's
Disease dementia.
And there are others
that are not specific
to Lewy Body Dementia
but were funded by
several biomarker projects
in Lewy Body Dementia.
So if we go to the next slide.
And currently there are ongoing
and new cohorts
that have contributed
to biomarker programs,
and this was mentioned
also in the cohorts talk,
but these are specifically
focusing on biomarkers,
the Parkinson's Disease
Biomarkers Program
that includes dementia
with Lewy Bodies
and Parkinson's
disease patients.
The North American Prodromal
Synucleinopathy Consortium,
that has a large
biomarker-characterized cohort
and ADRC cohorts
with the SCAN
initiative to standardize
imaging across the ADRCs,
which will likely include
a lot of dementia-with-Lewy-
Bodies cases.
The Parkinson's Progression
Markers
initiative of PD, prodromal PD
and genetic cohorts
and also the AMP-PD is
collecting data on biomarkers,
and then as was mentioned,
there is a lot of efforts for
harmonization of biomarker data
across European and Canadian
cohorts with the US cohorts
to establish common
data elements.
So the goals are
for these efforts
to standardize
biomarker collection
including imaging, DNA, plasma,
whole blood and CSF.
And longitudinal biomarker
collection
and clinical follow-up,
harmonization
for clinical phenotyping
and also encourage
brain donation,
that is critical for validation
of imaging biomarkers.
We go to the next slide.
Since 2019 with
accumulating data
from these funded research
and ongoing cohorts,
we have seen several
important developments.
We certainly do not have an
alpha-synuclein radioligand yet,
but we are getting closer,
so there has been a lot
of developments in this area,
and we hope that
this will become a reality
in the near future.
Now, we continue to establish
biomarkers for earlier stages
such as the prodromal
Lewy Body Dementia stages,
and we now understand
the contribution
of Alzheimer's pathology
to the clinical syndrome
better in Lewy Body Dementia,
which may inform us on treating
this pathology down the road.
And alpha-synuclein biomarkers
such as seeding assays
with RT-QuIC and PMCA in CSF
and skin have also seen
major diagnostic advances.
And, furthermore,
there have been developments
in digital biomarkers,
and these require
new analytic approaches
in Lewy Body Dementia.
Now, next slide, so biomarkers
were already integrated
in the dementia-with-Lewy-Bodies
criteria back in 2017,
and they are now also included
in the research criteria
for prodromal stage of dementia
with Lewy Bodies.
And this framework not
only includes biomarkers
of Lewy-Body-related pathology
but also Alzheimer's pathology,
emphasizing that the clinical
phenotype may be determined
by the contribution
from multiple proteinopathies
and not just
alpha-synuclein pathology.
Next slide.
Biomarkers from biofluids
and tissues can inform us
about various aspects of Lewy
Body Dementia pathophysiology,
and different pathological
processes may require sampling
from a variety
of biofluids and tissues.
So we recommend that,
where appropriate,
biomarker discovery
and evaluation
should be carried out
in multiple tissues
such as skin, colon,
salivary gland and others,
also biofluids such
as whole blood, plasma,
CSF, urine, saliva, tears, even,
and microbial samples.
Next slide.
There are digital and
electrophysiological biomarkers
that are being developed
in the field,
and we need to try
and validate these biomarkers
in Lewy Body Dementia
cohorts.
So we recommend workshops
to define modalities
and best practices
with data sharing
and paying attention
to privacy
that would help bring
these promising technologies
into Lewy Body Dementia
biomarker field.
Next slide.
And coming to the gaps
that we still need
to fill regarding biomarkers
in Lewy Body Dementia,
first we need to develop,
refine and validate biomarkers
for prodromal
and, perhaps, eventually,
the preclinical stages
of the disease processes.
Now, development of the
alpha-synuclein tracers
will be highly impactful
for alpha-synuclein-modifying
treatments,
potentially for
patient selection,
treatment engagement
and efficacy.
Now, cohorts with
biomarker collection
should be harmonized
across NINDS
and NIA ADRC programs,
foundation-supported programs,
and should be diverse
and representative,
as we have discussed
this morning.
And the targeted as well
as Omics-type
approaches to biomarker
discovery and development
should also be pursued and more
integration of biofluid markers
across existing cohorts
that include imaging, genetic,
clinical and autopsy data,
is needed.
And a good example of this
is the Parkinson's Disease
Biomarkers Program.
We certainly have more work
to do on the applications
of digital and
electrophysiological biomarkers
that are being developed
in Lewy Body Disease Dementia.
So if we go to the next slide.
So these are the recommendations
for neuroimaging biomarkers
to develop, refine
and refine
neuroimaging biomarkers
that track disease
progression,
assist in differential
diagnosis,
provide therapeutic
target engagement
and relate to pathology.
To do that, we recommend
developing
and refining biomarkers
for Lewy Body Dementia
as well as the preclinical and
prodromal stages of the disease
and also supporting alpha-
synuclein tracer development.
There is potential
to repurpose
currently available
cost-effective imaging tools
that can be accessible
and applicable
in diverse settings
and diverse cohorts
and including sex differences,
as Dr. Leverenz has pointed out.
There is a really important
sex difference with women
being underrepresented
for a biological reason,
potentially, in these cohorts,
so that's an important
area of study, as well,
and also utilizing
a multisensor approach
to determine the scalability
of these techniques
and prepare for phase-three
multisensor trials
with harmonization and data
sharing in large cohorts.
Next slide.
-Two minutes remaining.
-Okay, so this is
recommendation number three
for the development
and refinement of biomarkers
for diagnosis, prediction
and prognosis
using the biofluids,
tissues and the digital
and electrophysiologic methods.
These biomarkers need to reflect
pathophysiological changes
related to Lewy Body Dementia
including multiple proteins
and vascular changes.
Also, biomarker measurements
need to have a defined context
in different biofluids
and tissue specimens.
We need to address study
disclosure of results
in asymptomatic
and mildly affected individuals,
and we need to develop
comparable biomarkers
in model systems including
animals and cell lines.
The digital and
electrophysiologic biomarkers
need to be applied
to Lewy Body Dementia,
and these may include wearables,
EEG and polysomnography,
computerized testing
and home-based monitoring.
That can include lifestyle,
behavior,
cognition
and neuropsychiatric symptoms
as well as autonomic function,
activity and sleep.
And finally, we need
to harmonize protocols
and common data elements
to allow integrated research.
And finally I would like
to get to the next slide.
I would like to thank you
for your attention
on the biomarkers topic.
Now it's my pleasure
to introduce
Dr. Sonja Scholz
from NINDs and NIH.
Dr. Scholz will be presenting
the recommendations
on neuropathology and genetics.
-Right.
Thank you for your introduction,
and thank you
for the opportunity
to talk to you today.
So we are now going to pivot
from the clinical focus area
to the more basic science side,
and so I will specifically talk
about the neuropathology
and genetic recommendations,
and then I have my colleague,
Dr. David Irwin,
following up on the disease
mechanisms recommendations.
I would like to recognize
my team members,
Dr. Clemens Scherzer,
Dr. Brittany Dugger,
Dr. David Irwin
and Dr. Dennis Dickson
for their contributions.
So next slide, please.
These are my disclosures.
Next one, please.
All right.
So these are specifically the
recommendations number five
and six in the handout.
If we go to the next one,
next one.
All right.
So it's exciting to see
that there has been really
a lot of progress happening
on the basic science side,
and I think it is --
We all recognized
and understanding
the very basic genetic,
epigenetic lifestyle
environmental factors
that are playing a role
in Lewy body dementias
is fundamental
for disease modeling
but also ultimately
for paving the way
for disease modification.
So specifically
on the genetic side,
there has been
a lot of progress,
and a lot of this progress
is really based on,
you know,
implementing recommendations
from previous ADRD summits.
We go to the next slide.
So, you know, really
making good use
of the various brain
donation programs
that have been established
but also, you know,
biorepositories.
We've been able to already
gain a lot of valuable insights
into the genetic architecture
of Lewy body dementia,
and so showing here,
for example,
is the LBD genome
sequencing initiative
which was really a team
science effort,
intramural, extramural effort
trying to combine whole genome
sequence data
from multiple sources
and perform state
of the art genome
sequencing for various
genomic analysis,
but also to generate
a foundational genomic resource
that can be used broadly to
accelerate the pace of discovery
in this understudied
disease field
and to democratize
data access.
Go to the next one.
So we've already learned
a lot of interesting lessons
just based on this
publicly available data,
so we know that Lewy body
dementia is a complex disease.
There are both common disease
risk variants playing a role,
but also rare variants
playing a role.
We recognize that in reality,
most patients, it is polygenic,
so it's a combination
of multiple variants
that are playing a role,
and they really have an impact
on the disease heterogeneity
that we clearly appreciate.
We also recognize,
just based on the genetics,
it tells us that there are very
clear molecular relationships
between Lewy body dementia
and other neurodegenerative
diseases,
so we can see
overlapping risk closer
with Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's disease,
but we also appreciate
overlapping disease pathways,
and that's particularly
exciting
because these pathways
are particularly relevant
for possible disease
modification interventions
that could be relevant to much
broader patient population
than just the Lewy
body dementia cases.
However, most of the progress
that has been made
on the genetics side
is really predominantly done
in individuals
of European ancestry,
and we already appreciate,
based on Canada gene approaches,
that there is considerable
population heterogeneity.
So improving the diversity
of patients that we study
is an important need
for the field,
as we are also building up
and continue to improve
powerful genetic discovery.
Next slide, please.
But it's not just
a numbers game.
It's not just the number of
biospecimens that are available.
I think we also need to be smart
about generating
foundational datasets
that can accelerate
the pace of discovery
and kind of inform discovery,
and, you know,
it's been great to see
how a lot of the recommendations
have been put in place
to make these knowledge
platforms available.
So for example, the genome
resource that we generated
has been,
you know, made available
to the research community,
even prior to any publication,
and it's been really great
to see how it's being
used quite broadly,
accelerating the pace of
discovery in this disease field,
and we know that these
kind of knowledge platforms,
they will have to expand.
So it's not just genetic
information,
but we also in different
layers of homage data
to interpret
the functional variants
and put them in
a functional genomic context
and come up
with disease models
that we can then study
for therapeutic interventions.
Next, please.
Next, please.
Okay, but it's --
Sorry, just one back, please.
It's okay.
So we definitely need
more samples,
so biospecimens
and brain donation programs
will have to expand,
but we also need
a lot of accompanying
phenotypic information,
and ideally,
in-depth phenotype information
all the way from
the programmable stage
to the final stages
of the disease,
and this type of information
can be really valuable,
and I'm showing you
just an example of how,
you know, these
kind of data can be used.
In a recent study
by Dr. Scherzer's group,
you know, we've been
able to show
that there are risk loci
that modify the survival,
and so these kind of disease
modification genetic loci,
you know, identifying those,
it's only possible
because the available of
in-depth phenotypic information,
and so there is a lot
of interesting angle to that,
but again,
we need to improve
the number of ancestrally
diverse individuals
to see how broadly
that it really affects
the patient population.
Going to the next one,
there are many --
You know, there are many gaps
in our knowledge,
so obviously we have
to still address
the missing heritability,
and this is where
increasing biorepositories,
brain donation programs
are really going to be key,
but also using modern
technologies as they unfold
to study rarer-used
genetic variation type.
Integrating the multi-omic data
into a knowledge platform
that can be easily shared
and accessed
is also key
to advancing the field
and particularly taking,
you know,
the genetic information
that we see into a cellular
context and understand
how it actually is causing
disease on a molecular level.
I think we have already heard
from other groups
that we all need
to double down on our efforts
to increase the diversity
of patient study
in the genetic context
in particular.
You can go to the next one.
So coming to our specific
recommendations
for the genetics of LBD,
so we recommend to delineate
the genetic loci
on the functions,
contributing to the onset
and progression of LBDs
using genetic,
transcriptomic, epigenetic
and environmental analysis,
and so this is going
to be used to --
obviously to discover and
replicate genetic risk variants
which is at the core,
at the foundation for getting
insights
into the genetic architecture
and the molecular
function of LBD.
Next one.
We have to expand the
recruitment of cross-sectional
and longitudinal
deeply phenotype
cohorts and families,
ideally of diverse ancestry.
Next.
We have to translate
these risk variants
that we're identifying
using predominantly
through association
studies into disease
mechanisms.
Next.
And we want to examine
our relationships
between Lewy body dementia
and also related diseases,
as there are real cross-disease
treatment opportunities
that are emerging based on these
so-called pleiotropic
risk alleles.
Next one.
And as I already alluded to,
we want to have an expansion
of the data platforms
for user-friendly analytics.
Now we go to the next slide.
So there's also been
notable progress
on the neuropathological side.
So I think we appreciate,
you know,
the type and location of the,
I'll say, nuclear pathology,
and the classifications
have already been developed
and are broadly used.
Next slide.
But we recognize that we have
to standardize
the way the neuropathological
characterization is happening,
and the standardization
is not just relating
to the quantification
of the pathology that is there
but also relates to the
different type of techniques,
from the staining
to the type of sampling
that has to occur.
Next.
In addition, we recognize
that LBD,
pathologically speaking,
is a very heterogeneous disease.
There is -- You know,
the copathologies that exist,
they are not
there by chance.
They really matter.
They affect the phenotypic
presentations,
so we know that 60
to 80 percent of all cases
have Alzheimer's
copathology,
and, you know,
and even genetically speaking,
we already start to see
different architectures
in these high --
you know, pure versus
mixed pathology cases.
Next, please.
But we also appreciate
that there are other
pathological changes
that haven't been
sufficiently explored,
such as the TDP-43 copathology
that we increasingly appreciate
in about 20 percent of cases
as well as the vascular
disease copathologies with,
you know, microvasc
and macrovascular changes.
Next, please.
So there are notable gaps,
especially on
the neuropathology side as well,
so it is important
that we link information
all the way from the scientist
to the samples
to clinical information
using user-friendly portals
and unique identifiers.
We want to make it as easy as
possible to use these portals,
and in order to work
across different centers
that are generating samples,
that are collecting them,
it is important that we have
standardized techniques
for the quantification
of the pathology
but also for the sampling
process and the staining itself.
I think there are a lot
of unrealized opportunities
emerging on the digital image
analysis and deep learning side,
and I think we can
all agree that,
you know, we will
all benefit as a field
if we increase
the number of cases
that are ancestrally diverse.
So with that, I want to go
to the next side.
So here are recommendations
for the neuropathology.
So we want to enhance
and standardize the techniques
for neuropathological
characterization of LBD
and the use of
LBD pathology cohorts.
Next, please.
We want to establish
best practices
for the neuropathological
evaluation.
Next, please.
We have to develop
scalable methods
to assess the quality
of tissue samples.
Next.
We have to enhance
the infrastructure,
also to collect
tissue specimens
that are not
routinely collected.
We've already heard about
the importance of skin,
salivary gland, GI tissue
and perhaps even
solid organ samplings,
and we should facilitate that.
Next, please.
Next.
As I already mentioned,
we need very well-characterized
autopsy collections,
especially from ancestrally
diverse cases.
Next.
This will inform a lot
of the molecular,
you know, characterizations
and have already been ongoing,
and in order
to achieve that,
I think it's really
of fundamental importance
that we improve our outreach
and our education
to underrepresented groups
to engage them
in our research enterprise.
Next, please.
And we want to link
the tissue resources
that are being generated.
There's a concerted amount
of effort
that goes into there
with all the clinical,
that molecular biomarker data
using a single portal.
Next, please.
All right.
And so I'm going to hand
over the microphone
to the next speaker,
Dr. David Irwin.
Dr. Irwin is a cognitive
neurologist
at the University of Penn,
where he's particularly
interested in the brain behavior
and relationships of the ADRDs.
So the floor is yours.
Thank you.
-Thank you very much, Sonja.
Thank you to the organizers.
I'll be talking about
recommendations
seven and eight today,
that are focused on mechanisms
of Lewy body dementias,
and I want to recognize
the team members,
Drs. Cedarbaum, Dugger,
Lee and Scherzer,
who worked together with me
on these recommendations
as well as our
Lewy body group.
Next slide, please.
I have no disclosures.
Next slide, please.
So in review of our
2019 recommendations,
recommendation seven was
the understanding the molecular,
cellular pathophysiology
of alpha-synuclein
in the context
of non-motor brain regions,
and this focus was on
alpha-synuclein function
both in health and also
in the setting of human disease,
Lewy body dementia and a focus
outside of the motor areas
in the striatonigral system,
where there's been a large focus
in the context of PD,
and this is more to examine
the correlates
of the clinical features of LBD,
of Lewy body dementias.
Recommendation eight was
to identify mechanisms
by which Lewy body diseases
may spread between
and affect different
brain regions
and how Lewy bodies interact
with other pathologies.
So the focus of this
recommendation
was on the prion-like
spread mechanism from cell
to cell of pathogenic species
of alpha-synuclein
and how this may interact
with mixed pathologies of aging,
and the timeline
for these recommendations
was 2 to 4 years
for seven,
5 to 7 for recommendation eight
based on the amount of time
needed to make fundamental
basic advances
in scientific knowledge
for these recommendations.
Next slide, please.
So there's been
significant progress
in the field since 2019,
and to highlight
some general areas
and specific
exemplary studies
and reviews that capture some of
the main areas of advances,
one is the ability
to visualize alpha-synuclein
from the human brain.
We've heard earlier today
about different cryo-EM methods
to visualize tau,
and they've been similarly
applied to alpha-synuclein.
Here is, from a recent review,
a schematic
of 3D reconstructions
of alpha-synuclein,
both from preform fibrils
as well as from human brain,
in this case, from MSA brains,
and what these studies suggest
is that genetic alterations
of alpha-synuclein introduced
into preform fibrils
or modifications
can alter the structure,
and there may be
strain-like properties
of these structures
of alpha-synuclein
that are only more
recently visualized
in this level of detail.
Next slide, please.
Similarly, visualization
of alpha-synuclein specie
both in cell culture
and in human brain
using advanced
methods of microscopy
can help us understand
more of the complex nature
of alpha-synuclein
mediated neurodegeneration,
and what's depicted here
from a study from [Indistinct]
using a cell model
of alpha-synuclein seeding
with high-resolution
microscopy methods
paired with multi-omics,
proteomics
and gene
expression studies,
able to visualize
different cellular changes
related to synaptic
dysfunction, autophagy
and regulation
of protein turnover,
as well as mitochondrial
dysfunction
on the different steps from
alpha-synuclein misfolded seeds
to protofibrils
to more preform fibrils
and then more
advanced aggregations
reminiscent of Lewy bodies
in the human brain.
So this exemplify how these
newer methods are able
to enhance cellular models
for our understandings
of these complex
cellular processes.
Next slide, please.
This is the prion-like spread
data in animal and cell models,
continues to grow
for a mechanism
for alpha-synuclein mediated
neurodegeneration, as does --
As we heard earlier
in the biomarker
talk about the presence
of pathogenic alpha-synuclein
in peripheral tissues,
and in these series
of elegant experiments
from the group
at Johns Hopkins
showing that
peripherally administered
preform fibrils
of alpha-synuclein
into the myenteric plexus
of wild type mice
can induce a time-space
dependent
spread of pathogenic
alpha-synuclein in the brain,
recapitulating human disease
with motor
and cognitive impairments,
and importantly,
that process was ameliorated
by either vagotomy
to block that transmission
from cell to cell
or in a transgenic animal
that does not express
endogenous alpha-synuclein,
so importantly highlighting that
downregulating alpha-synuclein
may be one mechanism
to help us slow
or halt the propagation
of pathogenic alpha-synuclein.
Next slide, please.
As we heard earlier from Kejal,
in the Lewy body dementia,
mixed pathology is the rule,
not the exception,
and model systems need
to appropriately help us
understand the interactions
of these proteins.
This is from Virginia Lee
at Penn,
showing that
an amyloidosis model,
the 5xFAD mouse model that has
human pathogenic mutations
closing amyloidosis
in the mouse model
can accelerate the propagation
of both
preform fibrils
of alpha-synuclein
as well as human
Lewy body dementia-derived
pathogenic species
of alpha-synuclein
throughout the brain,
helping model
the interaction
between A-beta
and alpha-synuclein,
as depicted here,
aggregations of human
brain-derived alpha-synuclein
in these transgenic animals,
but not in wild type.
Next slide, please.
Model systems are advancing,
and we've heard
throughout the day
in different content areas,
the ability to have patient-
derived sources for models,
and this schematic
from a recent review
shows how induced pluripotent
stem cells technology,
the ability to program
fibroblast cells
or peripheral blood
mononuclear cells
into either 2D
patient-derived cultures
of specific types
of neurons.
In this case, visualized here
is dopaminergic neurons,
but can be programmed into
various other neuronal subtypes,
as well as 3D organoids provide
a very unique opportunity
not only to model disease
on an individual patient level
but also a possibility
to do drug screening
for various compounds.
This is an important step
towards a more personalized
medicine approach for treatment
of the Lewy body dementias
and also an ability to introduce
discoveries from genetic work,
as highlighted by Sonja,
into these models to then
help us understand
disease mechanisms.
Next slide, please.
In this schematic,
highlights the increasing role
that's thought to be related
to the immune system
in the pathogenesis of Lewy
body disease and dementias,
and what's highlighted here
in both the adaptive
and elements
of the innate immune system
and particularly in glia
in the brain,
both the normal function
of alpha-synuclein
that may involve certain aspects
of immune function
that's highlighted in red boxes
for the different cell types
as well as the ability
for normal
functioning alpha-synuclein
to bind to specific
immune receptors in blue,
and then finally, changes
biologically in immune cells
in response
to pathogenic aggregations
of alpha-synuclein in yellow,
and there are several aspects
here that they're missing data,
and a lot more to learn,
but there's increasing role
of non-cell autonomous
inflammatory mechanisms
that could contribute to
the neurodegenerative process.
Next slide, please.
And finally, recent work
highlighted here
showing two different
potential mechanisms
of enhancing immunotherapies
as potential
disease-modifying therapies
targeting alpha-synuclein
either with DNA vaccines
or through generation
of specific
conformers
of alpha-synuclein
to have a more specific target
for pathogenic alpha-synuclein
and potentially reduce
side effects of immunotherapy.
Next slide, please.
So despite these advances
since the previous summit,
there still remains fundamental
gaps to address in 2022,
which was the focus
of our work in our meetings
to prepare the revised
recommendations.
These include, you know,
advancing models even further
to fully recapitulate bona fide
human Lewy body disease
and dementias with aspects
that are directly related
to what we see in human disease
and particularly for mechanisms
that can help us understand
selective vulnerability
and the specific
neuronal subpopulations
that are particularly
vulnerable to develop
alpha-synuclein pathology
and neurodegeneration
and how these relate to the
heterogeneous clinical features
of Lewy body dementia
such as cognitive fluctuations,
visual hallucinations
and neuropsychiatric symptoms
as well as sleep disruption,
like REM sleep
behavior disorder.
And as well, there's a need to
develop further infrastructure
that can support the process
of screening potential compounds
and developing advances
in therapeutic developments
from the discoveries
for mechanistic models,
and then finally, how to more
fully integrate discoveries
from human genetic work
into model systems to help us
develop new targets
for drug discovery.
Slide, please.
So here are revised
recommendations seven and eight,
which we'll go through
and highlight
the main changes
and evolution from 2019.
So next slide, please.
So our 2022 recommendation seven
is to develop models
to understand
the pathophysiology and normal
molecular cellular functions
of alpha-synuclein
to support drug discovery,
and the goals for this
are 5 to 7 years.
Thank you.
So the focus and the major
changes to this
from the previous include
added focus to help accelerate
the translation
of mechanistic discoveries
to support drug discoveries
in therapeutics
and in collaboration
with priority one,
mentioned by Jim before,
and some of the highlights
of how to do this include
identifying regulators of SNCA,
alpha-synuclein gene expression,
and understanding the mechanisms
and potential effects
of downregulation
as a potential targetable
therapeutic strategy.
Next, please.
Characterization of pathological
alpha-synuclein strains
from the human brain,
further understanding
the variation
and structure and function
and features of alpha-synuclein
that are derived
from human brain
and the importance
of brain donation and autopsy
is critical for those efforts,
as is, we heard from Sonja,
efforts to help
accelerate access
to these tissues
in the research community.
Next, please.
Identifying mechanisms of aging
and sex differences
that are observed in human
autopsy and clinical work
that may play an important role,
these mechanisms,
in helping us
understand resilience
and how some individuals
may be resilient
to the accumulation
of alpha-synuclein pathology.
Next, please.
And finally, these efforts
work towards the goal
of promoting the discovery
of at least one new, novel drug
targeting emerging genetic
or neuropathological mechanisms
implicated in LBD,
so our focus is on
that translational pathway
to drug discovery.
Next slide, please.
So recommendation eight is
to identify mechanisms
of selective vulnerability,
disease heterogeneity,
disease spread and propagation
and interaction
with other
age-related pathologies
as therapeutic targets.
So this recommendation
has a similar time
frame of 5 to 7 years,
based on the nature
of these important fundamental,
basic mechanistic work
that's required
to address
these important issues.
Next, please.
So in particular,
identifying mechanisms
in which
alpha-synuclein interacts
with other age-related
copathologies,
that's been a theme that
we've heard throughout today,
of the common
co-occurrence of A-beta
and TDP-43 vascular pathology,
and how these may potentiate
or accelerate
different neurodegenerative.
Next slide, please.
Understanding the role
of the immune system
and inflammation
in LBD pathogenesis further,
models that help incorporate
aspects of the immune system
and the role of glia in
the neurodegenerative process.
Next slide, please.
Identifying biochemical/
molecular underpinnings
of regional
brain pathology in LBD,
this is important for us to help
link mechanistic findings
with clinical heterogeneity
and the varied symptoms of LBD,
and this would identify,
you know, potential targets
that could be mechanistic
as well as asymptomatic,
finding these
mechanistic substrates
of the core
features of LBD.
Next slide, please.
And finally, support for
preclinical drug development
based on new findings
from mechanistic studies,
so the ability to take these
model systems and harness them
and take these discoveries
to identify targets,
screen for new targets and go
from the bench to the bedside.
Next slide, please.
This concludes my presentation.
I look forward to
the Q&A session, so thank you.
-Thank you, Dr. Irwin.
I think we're heading on
to Q&A now,
and we have our first question.
-We do.
So the first one is going to be
Mr. Ellenbogen.
Michael, are you ready?
-Yes, thank you so much.
First, I'd like to say
I will miss my friend,
John Junkowitzski --
I'm sorry, Trojanowski.
He and I served on the
Pennsylvania planning committee,
and he was great.
Thank you for giving me
the opportunity
to speak here today
to all you directly
because, as a person
living with dementia,
I would not have been able
to place the writing in a chat.
We have made progress
in the last few years
sharing data among those
in the dementia arena,
but we still need to do better.
While I'm not a scientist
or an expert,
I do believe there is
some overlap
in some of these
other neurological disorders
that fall outside
of the dementia box.
I would recommend we find a way
to share information
among all of the neurological
diseases,
as together,
we will be stronger.
Thank you very much
for a great session today.
-Thanks, that was a great --
Some great comments,
and of course we'll all miss
John, John Trojanowski,
and I couldn't agree more.
I think most of the dementias
are multi-etiologic,
and again, appreciate
you sharing.
Are there other comments?
You want to go
to the next question?
-Sure.
The next question
is from Dale Lestina.
Dale, are you ready?
-I am now.
Take the mute off.
I find these sessions excellent.
I think my first one was 2018,
then 2019, and I learned a lot.
I'm learning more even now,
and I have some questions
that are related
to the previous sessions.
I learned that beta-amyloid
is associated
with the plaques quite literally
in between
the neurons in the brain.
I learned that tau is inside the
neuron, tangles and so forth.
What I didn't know,
as we're talking about here now,
is alpha-synuclein.
To me, that's a new one.
What does that --
How does that relate,
and what's --
to the other two and TDP-43.
What does the T and the P
and the D stand for?
Folks have got a lot of alphabet
soup for somebody
that just comes
in off the street
to try to catch up on,
and so I need a little schooling
on the vernacular that you use,
that you guys know,
you know, like everything,
but somebody like me,
I got a different alphabet soup
that I deal with.
So if you would, whoever would
help me out, James,
if you can pick who it is.
If it's you, fine, but I'd like
to learn on those two --
on those areas.
-Sure.
Those are great questions.
Who wants to handle
the explanation
of the different alphabet soup?
Somebody has to volunteer,
or I'll pick them.
-I'm going to put
something there for TDP-43
in the chat
because I don't know if --
I'm sure you've all tried
to explain it verbally,
but deacronym-izing TDP-43
is nearly impossible.
I think it's easier in writing,
so forgive me.
I'm going to put it in the chat.
-All right.
And I'll get it from that.
-Alpha-synuclein, I'll mention.
-Is it a tangle as well
when you look
at the molecule and so forth?
Is it a tangle like tau?
-It's --
TDP-43 is a different
kind of inclusion that we tend
to see in the brain cells
and particularly, we see it
in the frontotemporal dementias
as we talk about
frontotemporal dementia later.
I'm going to give Brittany
a chance,
and she raised her hand here
to talk as well about
some of the other acronyms.
-Thanks, Brittany, a lot.
-Oh, these are great questions,
and this is the whole point
of this too is dialog, right,
to form these dialogs,
and so the best way to describe
a lot of those things
that you mentioned,
these are normally
in our bodies, okay?
So just, like, think about how
cars are normally on a freeway
but then sometimes,
cars can run into each other,
and they get tangled up.
-Yep.
-So tau can get tangled up.
The amyloid can get tangled up,
the amyloid beta, so can TDP-43
and so can alpha-synuclein,
and these are all specific.
You could think of just maybe
even different types
of cars, right?
One could be a Honda, a Toyota.
I'm from Detroit, right?
So I'm going to be, like,
"That's
a Ford, a GM or a Chrysler,"
but does that help a little bit
from that analogy?
That helps me when I try
to understand things.
-Are they all proteins?
-Yeah, they're all proteins,
and they all get
into these car accidents.
So we all normally have them
in our body
but what we try to study is,
when do they go awry?
-Do the TD-43
and alpha-synuclein,
are they predominantly
in the neuron itself?
-Yes.
-Okay.
That helps me.
-And TDP normally stays
in the nucleus,
but what happens a lot
in these diseases is,
it goes away from that nucleus
of the neuron,
and we try to understand why.
-Oh, and how does it get out?
-Those are great questions
that we try to answer.
-Okay.
Well, I'm looking forward
to the next one as we go forward
is because I thought that
once inside the neuron
that you don't have to bust up
or die in order to get out,
but maybe not.
And now, is that
for alpha-synuclein,
and that's also in the nucleus?
And as I understood
the pictures here,
it looked like in the molecule
for that is a long,
stringy thing
just like for tau,
and then you can get them
all wrapped up,
and if that happens,
I've heard
that they can trigger the neuron
to commit suicide, kill itself.
Does that make sense?
-I'm going to pass this
to my colleague, Dr. Mosley.
I think he can help too.
He has his hand up.
-Well, you have
to write a grant.
You have a lot of stuff in here.
-Those are all great questions.
-Thank you, Brittany.
-Eliezer.
-Oh, yeah.
Thank you, James.
Yeah, alpha-synuclein
is a little bit different
because under normal conditions,
it's at the site
where the neurons connect
with each other sort of like,
you know, the same type
of connections
that you see in a computer
between transistors.
It's the same thing, but under
pathological conditions
like in Lewy body disease,
it means localized,
and it aggregates.
It accumulates in the cell body,
so it goes from the synaptic
connection to the cell body
where it causes
a traffic jam in the cell,
as Brittany was discussing,
but also it gets spit out
of the cell and propagates
from one cell to another
including inflammatory cells
causing a firestorm
in the brain, so to speak.
So -- But, you know, we'll be
happy to post on the chat
the link to our website,
the NIA and NINDS website,
where all this information,
it's available and a lot more.
I think you'll find it
very helpful.
-Well, I appreciate you
all that have chimed
in on my question.
Thank you very much.
That's always nice to learn.
-Thank you, Dale.
-These are great questions,
actually.
Kejal, do you want to handle
the next one, next question?
-Sure.
The next question
comes from Helen Medsger,
if you could
take the microphone.
-Hello, there.
I want to thank
everybody for today.
I've been in this battle
with Lewy body dementia
for over 30 years.
I've had three
first-degree relatives
that have succumbed to it:
my dad, my sister
and my youngest brother,
and I've had the pleasure,
actually, to either work with
or meet some of you
at various conferences.
But I'm wondering because
I already have,
you know, two generations
in my family in genetic study,
but those were formulated
back in, you know, the 2000s,
and so it's part of
Parkinson's disease study,
and even though I'm currently
involved in a variety of PPMI,
healthy brain aging
and all the rest,
is there a pipeline for those
of us that have been this
impacted to kind of fast-track
into certain studies
or at least put ourselves
on a specialized registry
so that you have access to us?
Because I think that, you know,
I'm pushing my family
to be more and more involved
because I want to see,
you know, research
as accelerated as possible
to get answers,
and that's kind
of my first question.
My second one has to do is,
we didn't directly address
GBA today,
and I know that, Dr. Scholz,
you had done that at the last
international conference,
so I was wondering
why that wasn't --
SNCA was mostly targeted today,
why GBA was not highlighted.
-Thank you for this question,
and thank you for participating
in research studies
and cohort studies
with your family as well.
That's wonderful.
I will direct this question
to Sonja
because it's about genetics.
-Yes, so thank you so much
for this interesting discussion
and really good question.
So we definitely
appreciate participant
in the various
clinical trials.
At the present time, I mean,
we don't have a one-stop-shop
where anybody
with a family history can go,
so people, you know,
usually find an array
of different study centers,
but many of them are now feeding
into these biorepositories
that researchers can access.
So, for example, the Parkinson's
disease biomarker program,
they receive samples
from different studies
but for the researchers,
we can access them,
and so it doesn't always
have to be a one-stop-shop.
So some of these
resources exist,
and they're definitely
very used,
and they're extremely helpful.
There's a lot of, you know,
exciting development on many,
you know, already no-risk
[Indistinct]
and you mentioned GBA
as one of them,
so aside from ACOE
that we've talked a little bit.
You know, about 13 percent
of LBD cases
actually have a risk variant
in this particular gene,
and it's told us
a lot already about,
you know, where in the cell
the misfunction is happening.
It tells us that the handling
of the proteins
is not functioning
well enough.
There's already, you know,
exciting clinical trials
ongoing mainly on
the Parkinson's disease side
because the Parkinson's
disease side
is a little bit
further along.
They have already developed
a lot of the outcome measures
that we use
for clinical trials,
but it's obvious that
the next patient population
in which,
you know,
GBA-targeted interventions
are going to be started
is going to be
the Lewy body dementia cases.
So it's just --
But it tells us very nicely
that we actually,
by paying attention
to the related fields,
we can learn a lot
from each other,
and so the Parkinson's field
has accelerated
Lewy body
dementia research,
and I think it's happening
now also in return.
A lot of insights that we're
gaining in Lewy body dementia
is also informing
Parkinson's disease.
So the similarities and
the differences
are really quite instructive
about very fundamental
mechanisms
that are happening
in the brain.
There's more work to be done,
but I appreciate, you know,
your participant,
and, you know, I'm sure
we have more to talk about
at the next summit as well.
-And I just want to,
as an after --
you know, an after-statement,
I just want to promote the fact
that the International
Lewy Body Dementia Conference
is coming up in June
in Newcastle,
so I'm hoping to see
many of you there, please.
-Thank you.
-See you there.
-Yeah.
-The next question, Jim,
would you like to take that?
-Sure.
I think this is Barbara Boehm.
-Hi.
Hello.
This is my first time,
and it's a pleasure listening
to all of you and meeting you.
My father was diagnosed last
year with Lewy body dementia.
He was originally diagnosed
with Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's disease,
so this is fairly new,
so my question is basically,
his family has a history
of Parkinson's disease,
and I'm wondering if there's
a genetic connection
associated with that.
You know, based on the research
that I've been
listening from Sonja,
have you noticed any kind of
trends of behaviors that,
you know, indicate that it's
more genetic than an anomaly?
-So it looks like Dr. Scherzer
has hand up, so he can start.
-Okay.
-Then we can go to Sonja.
-Yeah, so, yes.
So actually, this is a very
important area
where we're starting to unravel
the genetic contribution
to Lewy body dementias,
and there's clearly
an important genetic factor,
but what you're also
pointing out
is that there's
an important linkage.
We used to think about these
diseases as different silos,
Parkinson's disease,
Alzheimer's disease,
Lewy body dementia,
but in reality,
these clinical silos,
this is a very simplistic view
and at the level of genetics
and at the level of looking
at the brain, these,
the pathways for these three
diseases are actually linked,
and so we see that some --
There are some genetic closeness
like APOE
and perhaps WWOX-1
that are linked to Alzheimer's
but also to Lewy body dementia
and also linked to
Parkinson's patients at risk
for developing dementia.
-I just want to say that,
you know,
the genetics is just
one piece of the puzzle.
I think there are so many
different factors
that are playing a role,
so I mentioned genetics,
but there's also lifestyle,
environmental factors
and what we call epigenetics
which is kind of
the intersection
between the environment
and the genetic fingerprint.
And so while we recognize
the genetic plays a role,
it's not everything.
So it gives us at least some,
you know, areas in the cell
that we can put our fingers on,
and we can model it,
but not everybody
who carries risk variant
necessarily will have
to develop the disease.
We recognize it is one piece
of the puzzle,
but there's many other factors,
in particular the aging,
that are playing a role.
And so, you know, in aggregate,
we'll have to understand
the more complex changes
of aging
and how some of these, you know,
risk factors are then in contact
with aging
and environmental factors
are causing the cell death
and the disease to happen.
-So, Sonja, just to --
a question in regards
to what you're saying.
As far as the
environmental factors,
can you provide me an example
as far as environmental?
Is it toxins
or a particular job?
Let's say if he was working
in manufacturing,
and there was a lot of toxins
in the environment.
Would that be
a contribution factor?
-Yeah.
That's a great question.
I think, you know,
there's definitely --
We've gained some insights,
but I also want to say
that the epidemiology,
there's still a lot of room
to grow.
So we're seeing, for example,
the pesticides are associated.
Rural living is associated
with higher risk
for Lewy body dementia
but also related diseases,
Parkinson's disease,
and I think, you know,
what these kind of toxins
are doing
is that they are targeting
specific functions in the cell,
in the machinery,
and so maybe in concert
with being a little bit
genetically predisposed,
if you have a lot of exposure
to these toxins,
it may be enough
to drive the disease
mechanism as you're aging.
And so that, for example,
there's also been discussion
about heavy metals,
solvents, but I think
we still don't understand
all of the environmental factors
that are playing a role
especially over a lifetime.
-Okay.
All right.
Thank you so much
for answering my questions.
I really appreciate it.
Thank you, again, for all
the hard work you're doing.
-Thank you.
-Thanks for the
great questions.
Worth noting as well,
I hate to be my recruiter,
but there are lots of centers
around the country now focused
on Lewy body disease,
and if there's any interest,
people can certainly look
at the PWP website, for example.
I think you're up next.
-John Paul Taylor, I believe,
has joined us and willing
to ask his question.
Hi, John Paul.
-Hi, y'all.
-He's joining us from UK.
-It's been a really
great session,
and I'm so pleased
to have joined you guys.
I just have a question with
regard to disease heterogeneity,
and I suppose this is coming
from my basis
of being a clinician
who sees people with LBD,
and I'm always struck by the
range and tapestry of symptoms
that people experience,
you know,
and it really is diverse
and, you know,
the range of progression
that people experience,
and I suppose I did wonder
through the recommendations
if there needs to be
a little bit more of, I suppose,
a nod towards this heterogeneity
so we can move beyond,
I suppose, our categorical
diagnostic nomenclatures
or, I think,
silos was a good term
towards perhaps more phenotypic
dimensional axes?
So we think about the severity
of motor symptoms,
sleep symptoms,
autonomic, neuropsychiatric
and, indeed,
also progression
and, I suppose importantly,
resilience to damage.
So I just wanted to get
the panel's view
on that perspective.
-Very good question, John Paul.
I can talk to the biomarker
perspective that heterogeneity
is definitely there in terms
of the variety of biomarker,
you know, measurements
we're seeing
in Lewy body
dementia patients,
and how that translates
into the clinical phenotyping
is also important,
and certain biomarkers hatch
on to certain phenotypes,
and that really explains
some of the heterogeneity,
but there's, of course,
all the other ones
with genetics and pathologic
heterogeneity and so on.
So I will give some time
to Dr. Cedarbaum here
and Angela Taylor to make
comments on this as well.
-Yeah, so, thanks, Kejal.
John Paul,
that's a great question,
and I wanted to come at it
from the clinical
trials perspective
because I, like you,
find this a challenge
but also an opportunity,
and it's sort of
an RDoC-like thing,
and the fact
that Lewy body dementia
is really the classic
multiproteinopathy,
if you will, disease
where we think,
at least, we have some idea of
how to trace certain symptoms
to certain underlying
protein abnormalities
in the brain or circuits
in the brain,
we shouldn't let it
overwhelm us.
And I think you're absolutely
right that this disease
provides us an opportunity
to test out drugs
directed at various targets
not only for disease
modification
but for symptom control which
patients desperately need now
as we're working out
the mechanisms
of disease modification,
and I think it is something.
I agree with you.
This is something
we should keep in mind
as we think about therapeutics
and therapeutics development
for Lewy body dementia.
-Thank you, Jesse.
Angela?
-Hi, John Paul.
I just want to respond to your
question
through the lens
of the Dementia Nomenclature
Initiative which actually has
its roots here in this summit.
One of the things,
one of the recommendations
that's coming up
out of this initiative
is the importance
of clear communication
and perhaps
different definitions
between the syndromes
from the pathophysiologies
and the importance of maybe
using those syndromic
descriptive
terms to allow for more focus
on the underlying disease
process itself.
We also are going to be looking
at highlighting the importance
of communicating severity
by domain, symptomatic domains,
and not just looking at it
all through the lens
of how severe is the dementia
but making sure
that through research
all the way
through delivery, diagnosis
and clinical management
that we open up the information
flow about
those different domains
as a matter of clinical
management and ongoing care
and helping the families look
at this from a perspective of,
where are we in comparison
to where we might be going?
So I hope that's also helpful.
-Thanks, all.
That's really, really useful.
Great chat.
-Thank you, and I think we have
come to the end of our session.
I will hand it over to Jim
to close our session.
-Just great questions
and nice discussion.
I really appreciate
the contributions, Kejal.
Thank you and all the members
of the LBD group,
and end of the first day,
I guess, and onto day two.
-Yes, and thank you to you,
Dr. Leverenz and Dr. Kantarci.
Fantastic day one, everybody.
We've been waiting for this
for 3 years
and, you know, preparing for
6 months, and here we are.
So see you tomorrow at 10
o'clock Eastern Standard Time,
same place, same time and for
another day of fantastic summit.
Have a good night, everybody.
-Thank you.
-Good chat, folks.
Thank you.
-All right.
