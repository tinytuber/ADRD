&gt;&gt; DR. IADECOLA: HI.  THIS
IS 
CONSTANTINO IADECOLA.  CAN I 
HAVE MY FIRST SLIDE?
I AM A NEUROLOGIST FROM WEILL 
CORNELL MEDICAL COLLEGE IN NEW 
YORK AND HAVE NO DISCLOSURES, 
AND I AM HONORED TO BE PART OF 
THIS DISTINGUISHED GROUP, AND 
PROVIDE SOME INPUT INTO THIS 
VERY IMPORTANT MEDICAL ISSUES 
THAT WE ARE FACING. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
OKAY SO THIS IS THE  
RECOMMENDATION WHICH HAVE TO DO 
WITH THE BASIC MECHANISMS AND 
THE RECOMMENDATION TO ADVANCE 
BASIC RESEARCH AND EXPERIMENTAL 
MODELS ON SINGLE, MULTIPLE 
INTERACTIVE MECHANISMS DRIVING 
MIXED PATHOLOGY, INCLUDING 
COMORBIDITIES ACROSS TEXAS, 
WITH EMPHASIS ON THE VALIDATION 
OF HUMAN DATA SET AND 
IDENTIFICATION OF THERAPEUTIC 
TARGETS. 
SO PARTICULARLY WE NEED TO 
DEVELOP NEW MODELS OF MIXED 
PATHOLOGY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT 
THE COURSE OF THE DISEASES, THE 
INTERACTION OF THE DIFFERENT 
PATHOLOGIES, CRITICAL 
CHECKPOINT FOR THE IMPACT OF 
THESE PATHOLOGIES, AND OVER THE 
LIFE COURSE THE THERAPEUTIC 
WINDOWS THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE 
AND NEEDED. 
CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF SEX, AGE 
AND COMORBIDITY, AT THIS POINT 
DR. KOROSHETZ EMPHASIZE THE 
IMPORTANCE OF AGING IN THE 
EMERGENCE OF MIXED PATHOLOGIES. 
THAT IS GOING TO BE VERY, VERY 
IMPORTANT ASPECT TO BE 
CONSIDERED. 
AND ALSO TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE 
THE KEY DRIVERS OF THIS 
PATHOLOGY. AND WHAT ARE THE 
ULTIMATE FACTORS. 
TO THIS UNDERSTANDING OF THIS 
INTERACTION, WE MAY BE ABLE TO 
FIGURE OUT NEW THERAPEUTIC 
INTERVENTION THAT MAY BE 
EFFECTIVE. 
AS EMPHASIZED BY DR. ERTEKIN 
TANER'S REPORT FROM THE 
NATIONAL ACADEMY REPORT, WE 
NEED TO HAVE METABOLIC RESEARCH 
TO APPLY IN THE DIFFERENT 
MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAMS 
NECESSARY TO CRACK THIS VERY 
COMPLEX PROBLEM OF THIS 
MULTIPLE PATHOLOGIES. 
WE NEED AN OPEN ACCESS 
REPOSITORIES.  THERE ARE A LOT 
OF EXISTING REPOSITORIES. WE 
NEED TO ADD HARMONIZATION, AND 
WE NEED EVERYTHING TO BE EASY 
TO BE ACCESSIBLE AND SEARCHABLE 
AN UP ONLINE SO THAT PROTOCOLS 
CAN BE REPRODUCED, AND METHODS 
CAN BE ESTABLISHED AND SO ON. 
AND FINALLY WE NEED TO 
EMPHASIZE THE PUBLIC PRIVATE 
PARTNERSHIP AND RAPIDLY REACH A 
CONSENSUS ABOUT THERAPEUTIC 
TARGETS AND MODEL INTERVENTIONS 
SO THIS NEW DISCOVERIES CAN BE 
RAPIDLY TRANSLATED INTO THE 
CLINIC. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THERE IS A VERY UNIQUE AND 
COMPLEX FRAMEWORK IN MULTIPLE 
DEMENTIAS, HAS TO DO WITH THE 
IMPACT OF MULTIPLE THERAPIES.  
AND THIS CAN BE CONSIDERED IN 
DIFFERENT WAYS. 
FOR EXAMPLE YOU MAY HAVE A 
MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT 
PATHOLOGIST, LIKE 1, 2 AND 3 IN 
DIFFERENT REGIONS AND EACH ONE 
LEADING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF 
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT.  YOU MAY 
HAVE DIFFERENT COGNITIVE 
DOMAINS BEING AFFECTED BY EACH 
INDEPENDENT PATHOLOGY. 
ESSENTIALLY THE IMPACT WOULD BE 
ADDITIVE, ONE TO THE OTHER. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
IN THESE SCENARIOS THERE IS A 
DRIVING PATHOLOGY RESPONSIBLE 
FOR DOWNSTREAM PATHOLOGIES AS 
SHOWN HERE. 
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE DOMINANT 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE YOU HAVE A 
PATHOLOGY DRIVING -- YOU HAVE A 
SITUATION WHERE A PATHOLOGY 
DRIVES THE OTHERS AND THE 
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT-- NEXT 
SLIDE -- THE COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT IS A RESULT OF THIS 
ADDITIVE PATHOLOGIES THAT MAY 
OCCUR. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
ONE OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF THIS 
ISSUE IS UNDERLINED BY THE FACT 
THAT THESE PATHOLOGIES MAY BE 
INTERACTING. SO FOR EXAMPLE 
(INDISCERNIBLE) MAY LEAD TO 
(INDISCERNIBLE) PATHOLOGY IN 
THEM INTERACT RECIPROCALLY, AND 
AMPLIFYING THE COGNITIVE 
IMPACT. AND THESE PATHOLOGIES 
MAY BE LOCATED IN DIFFERENT 
BRAIN REGIONS AND MAY BE 
CONNECTED TO PATHWAYS WHICH MAY 
LEAD TO THE PATHOLOGY 
DEVELOPING IN A DIFFERENT BRAIN 
REGION. LIKE WE DISCOVERED FOR 
(INDISCERNIBLE) WHERE THERE IS 
A SPREAD OF THE PATHOLOGY IN 
DIFFERENT BRAIN REGIONS. 
SO CLEARLY WE NEED TO 
UNDERSTAND ALL OF THESE 
INTERACTIONS TO REALLY COME UP 
WITH EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
WHAT WE REALLY NEED -- NEXT -- 
WOULD BE TO AGAIN DEVELOP 
MODELS THAT REFLECT THE 
COMPLEXITY OF THIS MULTI 
DEMENTIA, WE MAY REFLECT THE 
COMPLICITY OF DIFFERENT 
PATHOLOGIES, AGAIN THE ROLE OF 
SEX AND COMORBIDITY IS GOING TO 
BE CRITICAL, IDENTIFYING 
HUMAN-BASED METHODS SUCH AS IP 
CELLS AND ORGANOIDS AND SOMEONE 
THAT MAY LEAD TO A BETTER 
TRANSLATION INTO THE HUMAN. 
AND DEVELOP DATA REPOSITORIES 
IN AN OPEN AND EASILY 
ACCESSIBLE, AND MOVE TOWARDS 
TRANSLATION.
BECAUSE ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS 
IS GOING TO BE TO DETERMINE 
WHAT IS THE PATHOLOGY THAT IS 
MOST PREVAILING FOR AFFECTING 
THE KIND OF IMPACT OF THE 
PATHOLOGY?
SOME OF THIS MIGHT BE BASED 
STANDARDS; SOME MAY BE MORE 
DIRECTED TOWARDS THE COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT. 
I AM DONE I THINK, AHEAD OF 
TIME.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; DR. FARDO: THANK YOU
DR. 
IADECOLA. I AM DAVID FARDO, 
BIOSTATISTICIAN AND STATISTICAL 
GENETICIST FROM THE UNIVERSITY 
OF KENTUCKY. I AM HAPPY TO 
PRESENT THIS ON BEHALF OF THE 
NINDS WORKING GROUP AND THE 
SPECTRUM FROM BASIC 
TRANSLATIONAL AND CLINICAL 
RESEARCH AND DATA 
STANDARDIZATION, HARMONIZATION, 
AND INTEGRATION. I HAVE NO 
DISCLOSURES. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THIS DATA RECOMMENDATION IS 
SUPPORTING MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY 
DEMENTIAS  FAIRLY BROAD IN 
SCOPE INTENDED TO SUPPORT A 
BROAD SPECTRUM OF RESEARCH WITH 
TARGETED EFFORTS TO 
STANDARDIZE, HARMONIZE, AND 
INTEGRATE MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY 
DATA FROM NEW AND EXISTING 
MODALITIES INCLUDING THAT FROM 
NOVEL CLINICAL AND BIOMARKER 
COLLECTION APPROACHES. 
SPECIFICALLY WE ARE ENDORSING 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL 
IMAGING, AND AI DRIVEN 
APPROACHES TO HARMONIZE DATA 
SETS ACROSS THE STATE 
PLATFORMS, AS WELL AS 
OPEN-SOURCE PLATFORMS FOR 
STORAGE, ANALYSIS, 
VISUALIZATION, AND INTEGRATION 
OF BOTH EXISTING AND NEW DATA 
WITH HARMONIZED AND IDEALLY 
CONSENSUS OF STANDARDIZED 
CONVENTIONS OF NED. 
AND EMPHASIZE EFFORTS FOR DRUG 
DEVELOPMENT REPURPOSING AND 
SHARED ANALYTICAL PRACTICES AND 
COMMON NED CODING TO PROMOTE 
HARMONIZED INTEGRATION ACROSS 
EMRS IN MULTIGROUP EFFORTS. 
WE ALSO RECOMMEND TO CREATE 
CONSENSUS QUALITY METRICS TO 
SUPPORT DATA INTEGRATION ACROSS 
BIOMARKER PLATFORMS AND COHORTS 
FOR CROSS STUDY COMPARISON AND 
AGGREGATION, AS WELL AS 
COOPERATION AMONG DATABASE 
GROUP SO THAT NED-SPECIFIC DATA 
CAN BE MOST PROBABLY, 
RESPONSIBLY AND SAFELY BE 
INTERCHANGED, AGGREGATED AND 
COMPARED. 
FINALLY, WE RECOMMEND 
SUPPORTING BY REPOSITORIES 
ACROSS ORGANIZATION TABS 
INCLUDING PUBLIC/PRIVATE 
PARTNERSHIPS TO ACHIEVE THIS 
RESEARCH SUPPORT. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THIS RECOMMENDATION IS 
MOTIVATED BY THE FOUNDATIONAL 
ROLE THAT QUALITY DATA PLAYS IN 
MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY DEMENTIA 
RESEARCH AND WE HAVE TO HAVE 
COMMON DEFINITIONS AND 
NOMENCLATURE REGARDING THIS.  
RECOMMENDING EFFORTS TO 
MAXIMIZE UTILITY IMPACT 
PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED DATA TO 
HONOR BOTH FINANCIAL AND HUMAN 
INVESTMENTS INCLUDING THAT OF 
OUR COMMITTED AND PASSIONATE 
RESEARCH VOLUNTEERS, BY 
INTEGRATING EXISTING AND NEW 
SOURCES OF DATA IN THE MOST 
EVER BE RESPONSIBLE AND 
EFFICIENT WAY POSSIBLE WE CAN 
MAXIMIZE STATISTICAL POWER AND 
OUR ABILITY TO MAKE 
STATISTICALLY RIGOROUS 
INFERENCES AND ADVANCES IN OUR 
UNDERSTANDING OF NED. 
ADDITIONALLY WITH A BACKDROP OF 
STRONG DATA PROTECTIONS 
ESPECIALLY FOR HUMAN SUBJECTS 
DATA, WE CAN DEMOCRATIZE AND 
DATA ACCESS FOR QUALIFIED 
RESEARCHERS, THUS PROVIDING 
OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE 
INVESTIGATION AND MORE 
ADVANCED. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THIS IS THE DEPICTION OF DATA 
COLLECTION AND PROCESSING FOR 
DIGITAL HISTOPATHOLOGY, GOING 
FROM RESEARCH VOLUNTEERS' 
DONATIONS OF THE RANGE THROUGH 
AUTOPSY, THROUGH STAGES OF 
PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS. 
WE RECOMMEND EFFORTS FOR OPEN 
SOURCE DIGITAL IMAGING, 
FOCUSING ON THE ABILITY TO 
RECOGNIZE DIFFERENCES IN 
APPROACHES HERE DEPICTED BY 
SINGLE NOTES, AND SUBSEQUENTLY 
HARMONIZED ACROSS THEM WITH THE 
GOAL OF SHARING AND INTEGRATING 
ACROSS COHORTS AND PLATFORMS. 
AND THEN DISSEMINATING TO 
INVESTIGATORS AS ROUNDLY AS 
POSSIBLE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THESE RESULTS ARE FROM AN 
EXAMPLE HARMONIZATION FOR 
MULTI-ETIOLOGY DEMENTIAS FOR 
NEURO- PATHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS 
AND SO THE FIGURE ON THE LEFT 
SHOWS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE 
PROTEINOPTHYS LIKE DR. CARLSSON 
DISPLAYED EARLIER OF TAO, -- 
AND TDP 43 FROM PARTICIPANTS IN 
SEVERAL COHORTS EACH ROW 
REPRESENTS A PATTERN OF 
MISCODED PROTEINS WITH RED 
INDICATOR PRESENCE AND GREY 
ABSENT. 
IN THE STATE OF THE FIRST ROAD 
INDICATES THAT THAT 384 OF THE 
-- BRAIN HAD AUTOPSIES. THE 
MAJORITY OF BRAINS EXHIBIT 
MULTIPLE PROTEIN OPATHIES 
SHOWING   THE AGE EXCEPTION OF 
INDIVIDUALS AND THIS POINTED 
MULTIPLE TIMES ON THE SUMMIT 
AND UNDERWRITE THE CORRELATION 
BETWEEN THOSE FOUR MISS FOLDER 
PROTEINS AN ADDITIONAL NEURO- 
PATHOLOGIC AND PHENOTYPES, AND 
THIS SHOWS INTERRELATEDNESS 
BETWEEN DISTINCT PHENOTYPES, 
AND IT ECHOES THE IMPORTANCE OF 
IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC DISEASE 
SUBTYPES THAT CAN BE TARGETED 
THERAPEUTICALLY. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THIS FINAL SLIDE, HIGHLIGHT TO 
EXISTING AND RELATED EFFORTS 
FOR RELATING DATA ACROSS 
STUDIES AND DATA TYPES AND WE 
ADVOCATE FOR THE EXPLICIT 
INCORPORATION OF NED. 
THE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
SEQUENCE PROJECT PHENOTYPE 
HARMONIZATION PROJECT BRINGS 
TOGETHER DATA FROM MULTIPLE 
MODALITIES INCLUDING 
LONGITUDINAL, COGNITIVE EXAMS, 
IMAGING BIOMARKERS AND 
NEUROPATHOLOGY.
AND ON THE RIGHT -- AGGREGATES 
GENETIC AND RELATED PHENOTYPIC 
DATA FROM MANY STUDIES AND 
MAKES THESE DATA AVAILABLE FOR 
QUALIFIED INVESTIGATORS. 
SIMILAR EFFORT SPECIFIC TO 
MULTI-ETIOLOGY DEMENTIA AND 
OTHER FOCUS GROUPS IS 
RECOMMENDED IN THE SUMMIT IN 
THE REPORT, NEEDED TO 
EFFICIENTLY ADVANCE DRUG AND 
CLINICAL TRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND 
PRECISION MEDICINE. THANK YOU. 
I WOULD NOT TURN IT OVER TO DR. 
CAITLIN LATIMER. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH MY
NAME IS 
CAITLIN LATIMER, A PATHOLOGIST 
AND ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT THE 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON 
SEATTLE. APPRECIATE THE 
PRIVILEGE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS 
WORKGROUP. I'M GOING TO BE 
TALKING ABOUT RECOMMENDATION 4, 
BUILDING A MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY 
DEMENTIA COMPETENT WORKFORCE. 
AND I HAVE NOTHING TO DISCLOSE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THE FIRST THREE RECOGNITIONS 
ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON DISCOVERY 
AND ADVANCEMENT AND DIAGNOSTIC 
AND THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES FOR 
NEDTHIS COMMISSION EMPHASIZES 
THE NEED TO DEVELOP A WORKFORCE 
THAT UNDERSTANDS AND RECOGNIZES 
THE CONCEPT OF MULTIPLE 
ETIOLOGY DEMENTIA, TO IMPROVE 
HOW WE STUDY, DIAGNOSE AND 
MANAGE INDIVIDUAL MULTIPLE 
DEGENERATIVE PATHOLOGIES. 
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WE UNDERLINE 
SEVERAL KEY POINTS EMPHASIZE. 
THE DEVELOPER WORKFORCE WE 
REALLY NEED TRAINING PROGRAMS 
THAT INTEGRATE MULTIPLE 
ETIOLOGY DEMENTIA PRINCIPLES 
AND THIS INCLUDES BASIC SCIENCE 
RESEARCHERS, CLINICIANS, 
CLINICAL CORNERS AND WE NEED 
EVERYONE INVOLVED IN DEMENTIA 
RESEARCH AND CARE TEAM EFFORT 
AND WE NEED TO INVEST IN 
IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE RESEARCH 
TO REACH A BROADER SWATH OF 
INVESTIGATORS AND CLINICIANS 
WHO ARE ENCOUNTERING 
INDIVIDUALS WITH MULTIPLE 
ETIOLOGY DEMENTIA ON A DAILY 
BASIS. 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SCIENCE 
CAN IN TURN HELP INFORM HOW TO 
INTEGRATE PRACTICAL TRAINING 
METHODS BACK INTO THOSE 
TRAINING PROGRAMS, TO 
FACILITATE THE ADOPTION OF MED 
CONCEPTS. AND ENSURE THAT NEW 
AND EVOLVING MED TOOLS ARE 
INTEGRATED IN RESEARCH STUDY 
DESIGN, AND PATIENT MANAGEMENT 
APPROACHES. 
AND FINALLY, PROMOTING 
EDUCATION ON THE USE OF NOVEL 
DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS TO MORE 
EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY 
IDENTIFY MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY 
DEMENTIA, AND COMMUNICATE THOSE 
FINDINGS WITH PATIENTS AND 
THEIR FAMILIES. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
CURRENTLY THERE ARE MULTIPLE 
CHALLENGES FACING THE DEMENTIA 
WORKFORCE. 
THESE REALLY BEGIN WITH 
AWARENESS. AS WE HEARD TODAY 
ALTHOUGH THE NEUROPATHOLOGY HAS 
SHOWN IS THAT MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY 
DEMENTIA IS A RULE NOT THE 
EXCEPTION, ON A DAILY BASIS 
MOST INDIVIDUALS ARE STILL PUT 
INTO EIGHT SINGULAR DIAGNOSTIC 
BUCKET. THAT IS THE ATTEMPT. 
 AND INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE 
PERVASIVENESS OF MULTIPLE 
ETIOLOGY DEMENTIA AND ITS 
POTENTIAL FOR DIAGNOSIS AND 
IMPACT , INPATIENT MANAGEMENT 
AS NEEDED BUT HAVING ACCESS TO 
EDUCATION AND HOW TO USE NOVEL 
TESTS FOR MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY 
EFFECTIVELY. 
AND THIS CAN LEAD TO DELAYED 
DIAGNOSIS AND POOR MITIGATION 
OR PERCEIVED POOR COMMUNICATION 
WITH PATIENTS AND FAMILIES 
WHICH LEADS TO FRUSTRATING 
ABOUT SIDES. 
AND UNDER BASIC SCIENCE AND 
CLINICAL TRIAL SITE 
INVESTIGATORS NEED TO BE AWARE 
OF THE POTENTIAL COMPOUNDS ON 
MULTIPLE IDEOLOGY DEMENTIA. 
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE 
MULTIPLE PATHOLOGY TRIALS, THE 
TRIAL MAY FAIL BECAUSE IT HAS 
NOTHING TO DO WITH EFFECTIVE 
TREATMENT AGAINST ALZHEIMER'S. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THIS RECOMMENDATION AIMS TO 
ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES IN TWO 
MAIN WAYS. 
THE FIRST IS PROMOTING TRAINING 
PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE CLINICAL 
TRIAL INVESTIGATORS, 
TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCHERS, AND 
BASIC SCIENTISTS WITH SKILL 
SETS TO INTEGRATE MULTIPLE 
ETIOLOGY DEMENTIA PRINCIPLES 
INTO RESEARCH STUDY DESIGN. 
AND SO AGAIN THINKING ABOUT THE 
UNDERLYING PATHOLOGIES OF THE 
STUDY POPULATION, WHETHER THAT 
IS IN CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN, 
TRANSLATIONAL STUDIES, OR BASIC 
SCIENCE TO ENSURE THAT MODELS 
OF MULTIPLE PATHOLOGIES ARE 
INCORPORATED RATHER THAN 
INDIVIDUAL PATHOLOGIES FOR 
STUDY. 
ALSO THE NEURAL PATHOLOGICAL 
FOR CHARACTERIZATION, ENSURING 
THE PATHOLOGISTS ARE PERFORMING 
COMPLETE ASSESSMENT AND 
DOCUMENTING AND COMMUNICATING 
THE PRESENT MULTIPLE ETIOLOGIES 
TO INFORM THE USE OF BY 
SPECIMENS FROM BIOLOGICALLY 
DIVERSE PARTICIPANTS. 
FOR EXAMPLE OFTEN FIELD 
REQUESTS FOR BY SPECIMENS FROM 
DONORS AND THE REQUESTED THAT 
HAVE ALZHEIMER'S OR DON'T HAVE 
IT AND WHEN I MEET WITH 
INVESTORS AND ASKED WHAT 
PATHOLOGIES THAT WANT TO 
INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE, THE CONCEPT 
OF MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY DOESN'T 
EVEN ENTER THE PICTURE. 
 AND SO FINALLY INFORMATICS TO 
LEVERAGE THE COMPLEX COVERT AND 
MODELING APPROACHES TO BETTER 
UNDERSTAND HOW THEY RELATE TO 
ONE ANOTHER AND THE CLINICAL 
PRESENTATION. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THE OTHER CLINICAL EMPHASIS IS 
IMPLEMENTATION OF SCIENCE. IN 
ORDER TO BUILD A MULTIPLE 
ETIOLOGY-COMPETENT WORKFORCE WE 
NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE 
CHALLENGES ARE FOR IMPLEMENTING 
NOVEL TESTS, AND APPROPRIATELY 
INTERPRETING, AND USING THOSE 
RESULTS. 
WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT 
THE MOST EFFECTIVE APPROACHES 
ARE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE 
SETTING AND THE EDUCATIONAL 
GOALS. 
AND FINALLY LEARN HOW TO 
INCREASE THE REACH OF THESE 
EFFORTS TO GENERATE BROADER 
ENGAGEMENT BOTH ON THE RESEARCH 
AND CLINICAL SIDE. 
&gt;&gt; TWO MINUTES. 
&gt;&gt; ULTIMATELY THESE
EFFORTS 
WILL ADDRESS THOSE CHALLENGES 
CURRENTLY FACING THE DEMENTIA 
WORKFORCE AND WILL BE ASSESSED 
BASED ON OUTCOMES RELATED TO 
BOTH THE PATIENTS AS WELL AS 
CLINICIANS AND RESEARCHERS. 
 SHORTER TIME TO DIAGNOSIS, 
IMPROVED COMMUNICATION WITH 
PATIENTS AND FAMILIES AND 
ULTIMATELY BETTER PATIENT 
EDUCATION AND SUPPORT. 
THAT IS ALL I HAVE. 
THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH
APPRECIATE 
ALL THE MEMBERS FOR THEIR 
CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO DR. 
LATIMER, DR. FARDO AND DR. 
IADECOLA FOR THE PRESENTATIONS. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. THE FIRST
Q&amp;A 
SESSION FOR THE SESSIONS TODAY, 
I WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE 
WHO IS ON THE COMMITTEE TO GO 
AHEAD AND TURN ON YOUR CAMERAS, 
SO WE CAN SEE WHO ALL IS HERE. 
FOR ANYONE ON THE COMMITTEE 
SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE 
YOUR MICROPHONE AND CAMERA 
UNDER YOUR CONTROL. THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; FIRST BEFORE WE BEGIN
OUR 
DISCUSSION, AS WAS DONE 
YESTERDAY, WE WANT TO WELCOME 
TWO OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. 
MR. AND MS. KAREN AND LARRY 
SQUIRES (PHONETIC), 
PARTICIPANTS WITH LIVED 
EXPERIENCE WHO HAVE SHAPED THE 
RECOGNITIONS OF OUR COMMITTEE. 
I WILL TURN IT OVER TO KAREN 
AND LARRY TO SHARE THEIR 
EXPERIENCE. WELCOME AND THANK 
YOU. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 
I HAVE A FEW COMMENTS. PLEASE 
IF YOU HAVE WRITTEN THEM DOWN 
BECAUSE I STRUGGLE WITH WORD 
FINDING AND I DON'T WANT TO 
MISS ANYTHING THAT IS 
IMPORTANT, OR THAT I FEEL IS 
IMPORTANT. 
FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK OUR 
FELLOW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE 
FOR ALLOWING US TO PROVIDE 
INPUT, AND CERTAINLY MAKING US 
FEEL WELCOME. THANK YOU. 
I HAD A 3-4 YEAR PATH TO MY 
PROBABLE DIAGNOSIS THAT WAS 
FILLED WITH MORE OBSTACLES THAN 
ONE WOULD EXPECT, AND ANXIETY. 
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND 
CLINICIANS WE FELT WERE 
KNOWLEDGEABLE AND BECAUSE OF MY 
ATYPICAL PRESENTATION. WE WORRY 
FOR THOSE WE JUST DON'T KNOW 
JUST HOW TO ADVOCATE FOR 
THEMSELVES. AND I WAS LUCKY TO 
HAVE KAREN WHO DID A WONDERFUL 
JOB TO ADVOCATE AND RESEARCH. 
KNOWING SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH 
YOUR BRAIN, AND NOT HAVING 
ANSWERS CREATES A TREMENDOUS 
AMOUNT OF FEAR AND ANXIETY IN 
YOUR LIFE.  AND SIMPLY HAVING A 
DIAGNOSIS OR A PROBABLE 
DIAGNOSIS, RELIEVES SOME OF 
THAT ISSUE.  THAT IS PRETTY 
MUCH IT FOR ME. 
THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; HE WOULD KEEP TALKING.
I AM 
CUTTING YOU OFF.
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. WE CANNOT 
COME UP WITH ANY OTHER MEDICAL 
ISSUES WHERE YOUR DOCTOR SAYS 
TO YOU, ALWAYS THINK YOU 
PROBABLY HAVE THIS.
SO, YOUR WORK IS REALLY 
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO BOTH 
DEMENTIA PATIENTS AND THEIR 
FAMILIES. WE JUST ASK THAT AS 
YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH RESEARCH, 
THAT YOU ALWAYS KEEP A CLEAR 
VISION OF THE IMPACT YOUR 
RESEARCH IS GOING TO HAVE ON 
THOSE PATIENTS. 
WILL IT EASE THE TIME AND 
ACCURACY OF THE DIAGNOSIS?
WOULD REVERSE THE SITUATION?
HAVING RELIABLE BIOMARKERS 
INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF 
MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY IS CRITICAL. 
AUTOPSY IS TOO LATE TO BE ABLE 
TO DEAL WITH PATIENTS LIKE 
THIS. AND TOO MANY CLINICIANS 
STOP AT ALZHEIMER'S. 
WE REALLY NEED ACCESS TO EASY 
BRAIN DONATION AND 
ENCOURAGEMENT FOR DONATION. 
WE EVEN THOUGHT TODAY AS WE 
WERE LISTENING TO EVERYBODY, 
HEY, HE HAS HAD LOTS OF SCANS 
AND LOTS OF TESTS DONE.  WHAT 
IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE 
WHO DON'T WANT TO DONATE THEIR 
BRAIN TO BE ABLE TO GRANT 
ACCESS TO THEIR SCANS AND TESTS?
TO PUT INTO THE RESEARCH. 
&gt;&gt; MY OPINION IS THAT
EVERYONE 
SHOULD BE ASKED. 
&gt;&gt; SO WE REALLY THANK YOU
FOR 
YOUR DEDICATION TO THIS 
RESEARCH.  AND AGAIN THANK YOU 
FOR LETTING US PARTICIPATE. 
&gt;&gt; DR. IADECOLA: IT IS OUR
PLEASURE AND PRIVILEGE TO WORK 
WITH YOU. AND YOUR INPUT WAS 
VERY IMPORTANT IN SHAPING, 
KEEPING US FOCUSED. BECAUSE 
PEOPLE (INDISCERNIBLE) WILL GO 
IN VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS 
AND YOU KEPT US GROUNDED AND 
YOU GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT WE 
SHOULD BE SHOOTING UP FOR. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. 
&gt;&gt; BEFORE WE GO TO THE 
QUESTIONS, IF I COULD MAKE A 
COMMENT TOO.  IT IS SUCH AN 
HONOR TO BE ABLE TO SERVE HERE; 
WE FOCUS ON RESEARCH BUT ALSO 
WE ARE CONNECTED WITH AT LEAST 
600,000 PEOPLE ACROSS THE US 
AND SO AS CONSTANTINO SAID, 
KEEPING YOU IN MIND WITH 
EVERYTHING AND WANTING IT WOULD 
LIKE TO EMPHASIZE IS WITH 
MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY WE HAD IT 
WRITTEN IN OUR TEXT BUT WE DID 
NOT VERBALLY EMPHASIZE THAT WE 
NEED TO GET THE FDA AND OTHER 
REGULATORY BODIES INVOLVED TO 
SOMEHOW TRY TO ACCELERATE 
TREATMENTS AND PREVENTIONS. 
RIGHT?
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IF YOU DEAL 
WITH EACH ONE OF THESE FOUR OR 
MORE  BIOMARKERS AT A TIME IT 
WILL BE LIKE 20-30 YEARS BEFORE 
YOU TRY TO PUT ALL 
ACCOMMODATIONS TOGETHER. SO IF 
YOU CAN BRING THE FDA AND OTHER 
REVELATORY BODIES IN TO TRY TO 
ACCELERATE GETTING NEW 
TREATMENTS TO THE CLINIC, THAT 
WILL HELP AFFECTED FAMILIES. 
&gt;&gt; SHALL WE GO TO THE
QUESTIONS 
CINDY?
&gt;&gt; CINDY YOU ARE MUTED. 
&gt;&gt; DR. CARLSSON: SORRY ANY
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE SYLVIA-- ASKING
A 
QUESTION. SYLVIA, GO AHEAD. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU THIS WAS A GREAT 
SESSION.  AND AS YOU ALL 
SHOWED, AND HIS I WILL 
REITERATE IN THE BCIB SESSION, 
THE GREAT MAJORITY OF DEMENTIA 
IS A COMBINATION OF ALZHEIMER'S 
AND VASCULAR PATHOLOGY. 
I WAS WONDERING IF WE SHOULD 
INTENSIFY EVEN MORE IN THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS, THAT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT TO STUDY ALZHEIMER'S, 
NOT IN ISOLATION AND VASCULAR 
PATHOLOGY, NOT IN ISOLATION BUT 
A COMBINATION OF THESE TWO 
PATHOLOGIES IN PARTICULAR. 
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU ARE PREACHING
TO 
THE CHOIR. 
&gt;&gt; NOTED. 
&gt;&gt; DR. IADECOLA:
OBVIOUSLY,  
VASCULAR PATHOLOGY FOUND ITS 
WAY IN ALL KINDS OF COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT. IT WOULD BE VERY 
IMPORTANT BEING THE MOST 
PREVALENT CONDITION. AND THE 
INTERACTION BETWEEN YOUR 
RECOMMENDATION AND OURS IS 
GOING TO TELL US WHAT TO DO AND 
HOW TO MOVE FORWARD. 
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY AND WE WANT TO
TELL 
THE NIH THAT THIS PARTICULAR 
COMBINATION IS REALLY 
IMPORTANT. 
&gt;&gt; YEAH. 
&gt;&gt; AND IF I COULD MAKE A 
COMMENT, THE EYE IS AN 
EXTENSION OF THE BRAIN AND 
REALLY GOOD WINDOW TO THE BRAIN 
AND USING THE EYE TO DIAGNOSE 
FASTER AND CHEAPER-- IT IS A 
LOT CHEAPER WITH THE 
FIVE-MINUTE SCAN, THEN GOING 
FOR A REALLY EXPENSIVE BRAIN 
SCAN. SO TALKING ABOUT THE 
CROSSOVER, LET'S BRING THE EYES 
IN AS WELL. 
&gt;&gt; NICOLE DO YOU WANT TO
GO 
FORWARD?
&gt;&gt; YES HI I'M A NAME IS 
NICOLE-- FROM THE ASSOCIATION 
OF (INDISCERNIBLE) NOT SURE 
THIS IS THE RIGHT GROUP BUT I 
AM WONDERING IF THERE IS 
THINKING ABOUT THE TRAINING OF 
POTENTIAL PEOPLE WORKING IN 
THIS AREA AND ACROSS RELATED 
DEMENTIAS LOOKING AT BEST 
PRACTICES FOR CARE REALLY 
UNDERSTANDING STATISTICALLY, IS 
THIS MEANINGFUL?
IS THIS BENEFICIAL?
AND PROVIDING QUALITY OF LIFE 
AND WELL-BEING ASSESSMENTS FOR 
THESE PEOPLE AND CAREGIVERS. 
ESPECIALLY WHO ARE SUFFERING 
FROM THESE DEMENTIAS. 
IS THERE A PLACE IN EITHER THIS 
GROUP OR OTHERS WE CAN 
HIGHLIGHT I GUESS STUDYING OF 
WELL-BEING FOR THESE DEMENTIAS?
&gt;&gt; INTERACT DIRECTLY WITH
HOW 
OUR COMMITTEE, AND THE 
EDUCATION ELEMENT GOES INTO THE 
COMMITTEE THAT WE SAW 
YESTERDAY. 
&gt;&gt; AND NOTING THIS. THANK
YOU 
VERY MUCH NICOLE. I THIS IS 
SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK TO 
INCORPORATE IN THE MED 
IMPLEMENTATION SESSION THAT WAS 
PRESENTED YESTERDAY, WHICH HAS 
A RECOMMENDATION ON CARE.
AND WE WILL SEE IF THIS CAN FIT 
INTO THE TRAINING 
RECOMMENDATION HERE.  THANK YOU 
FOR THAT IMPORTANT COMMENT. 
CAITLIN, ANYTHING TO ADD?
&gt;&gt; NOTHING SPECIFIC I
THINK 
THAT WE NEED TO-- INTEGRATING 
YESTERDAY'S AND TODAY'S, IN HOW 
WE ARE TREATING PATIENTS AND 
MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS GOOD 
COMMUNICATION I THINK ACROSS 
BOTH SIDES FROM BENCH TO 
BEDSIDE IS GOING TO BE REALLY 
IMPORTANT. 
&gt;&gt; BETSY?
DO YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD?
&gt;&gt; YES THANK YOU SO MUCH,
TO 
THE DEGREE THAT WE CONSIDER 
PCPS AS PART OF THE DEMENTIA 
WORKFORCE, HOW CAN WE NORMALIZE 
SIMPLE, NONINVASIVE SCREENINGS, 
COGNITIVE SCREENINGS AS PART OF 
WELLNESS EXAMS IN MUCH THE SAME 
WAY THAT WE NORMALIZE NOW COLON 
CANCER SCREENINGS AFTER A 
CERTAIN AGE, TO DIFFUSE THE 
FEAR OF THE GENERAL POPULATION 
AND JUST TO CAPTURE PEOPLE AT A 
MUCH EARLIER STAGE AND 
IMPORTANTLY, I'M WONDERING FROM 
THE MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE, FROM 
THE PCP PERSPECTIVE, IS VERY 
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THESE WOULD 
BE BILLED, ANY CONCERN ABOUT 
THE PCP COMMUNITY THEY MAY HAVE 
TROUBLE GETTING REIMBURSED FOR 
THE SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE AND 
COMMERCIAL CARRIERS CATCH UP TO 
THE IDEA THAT WE SHOULD BE 
DOING THESE SCREENINGS. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU
(INDISCERNIBLE). 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. I 
APPRECIATE THAT. I ALSO READ 
YOUR COMMENT AND EMAIL 
YESTERDAY ABOUT THIS. BY THE 
WAY WE READ EVERY SINGLE THING 
YOU SENT TO US. THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR THIS COMMENT. 
THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO THE 
RECOMMENDATION ON DIAGNOSIS 
FROM THE MED IMPLEMENTATION 
COMMITTEE YESTERDAY.  BUT I 
APPRECIATE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE 
THAT YOU OFFERED AROUND 
NORMALIZING THIS FOR PCPS. AND 
ALSO THE FOCUS ON BILLING. 
WE ARE GOING TO THINK ABOUT 
YOUR COMMENTS AS WE REVISE THAT 
RECOMMENDATION. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; I WAS GOING TO ADD, I
THINK 
ONE OF THE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
THAT PEOPLE HAVE, IS SUCH 
VARIED BACKGROUNDS AND 
EDUCATION. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE 
WE DON'T OVER DIAGNOSE. 
SOMETIMES HARD TO COMMUNICATE 
INTO BUSY, PRIMARY CARE 
PRACTICES. NOT BEING ABLE TO 
STICK WITH THE COGNITIVE POINT, 
HOPEFULLY A COMBINATION OF 
BIOMARKERS AND TRAINING AND 
COGNITIVE SCREENING TO BE 
COMBINED, AND NOT OVERDIAGNOSED 
AND LABEL SOMEONE, AND 
APPROPRIATE TO MOVE THEM 
FORWARD. 
&gt;&gt; I WILL ADD TOO THAT
WITH THE 
ID CONSORTIUM FUNDED BY THE 
NINDS, WE ARE DOING RESEARCH 
EVALUATE PATIENTS FOR THE BRAIN 
HEALTH WHEN THERE IS A CONCERN, 
RATHER THAN SCREENING 
EVERYBODY. WE ARE TRYING 
PATHWAYS WE ARE ASKING IF THERE 
IS A CONCERN IN A SYSTEMATIC 
WAY. BUT NOT ADVOCATING AT THIS 
POINT FOR DOING A FULL 
EVALUATION ON EVERY PERSON OF 
OLDER AGE. BECAUSE THERE ARE 
CONCERNS ABOUT FALSE POSITIVES, 
AND RESOURCES AND PRIMARY CARE 
TO PUSH FORWARD AT THIS TIME. 
IT IS SOMETHING WE ARE ALWAYS 
THINKING ABOUT. AND THE 
PRACTICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON 
THAT MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.  
ESPECIALLY AS BETTER TREATMENTS 
ARE AVAILABLE.
&gt;&gt; BEN?
&gt;&gt; YES. HI, THANK YOU. AND
GREETINGS FROM DRESSLER 
UNIVERSITY. 
YESTERDAY WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT 
BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS, ABOUT 
TECHNOLOGIES AND BRAIN IMAGING. 
I'M WONDERING WHY WE HAVE NOT 
HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT HUMAN 
MOVEMENT, OR MOBILITY AND 
BIOMECHANICS. 
&gt;&gt; I GUESS DAVID SHOULD
ADDRESS 
THAT, MAYBE?
&gt;&gt; DR. FARDO: YES SURE.  I
OUR 
RECOMMENDATION IS BROADLY FOR 
BIOMARKER, BRINGING IN 
BIOMARKERS NOT NECESSARILY FROM 
A SPECIFIC DOMAIN. SO, IT'S ... 
OPEN TO THE FLAVOR OF 
BIOMARKER, THE CRUX  FROM THE 
DATA PERSPECTIVE IS WE CAN DO 
THINGS THAT ARE SHARED ACROSS 
DIFFERENT GROUPS IN A WAY THAT 
WE HAVE APPLES TO APPLES; AND 
CAN GARNER MORE RESOURCES 
ACROSS INSTITUTIONS, SO THAT WE 
CAN BETTER POWER OUR STUDIES. 
&gt;&gt; DR. IADECOLA: AND I
THINK 
CORRELATING THE TRADITIONAL 
BIOMARKER WITH MOVEMENT, 
BIOMECHANICAL BIOMARKERS, HAS 
REALLY PANNED OUT. BECAUSE 
SLOWING OF THE MOVEMENT IS 
RELATED TO WHITE MATTER DISEASE 
FOR EXAMPLE. SO WE ARE ALREADY 
ON THAT TRACK, AND I WE SHOULD 
EMPHASIZE THAT MOVING FORWARD. 
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE 
COMMENT. 
&gt;&gt; DR. CARLSSON: WE TRY TO
CAPTURE THAT SO WE INITIALLY 
HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF 
BIOMARKERS. AND SO WE GROUPED 
THEM UNDER NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL. 
YOUR COMMENTS ARE WELL TAKEN 
AND THERE WILL BE NEW MARKERS 
PROMISING TO CAPTURE NEW ASPECT 
WE HAVEN'T BEFORE. THANK YOU 
FOR THAT. 
&gt;&gt; JULIE?
&gt;&gt; JULIETTE -- THANK YOU. 
ONE STUDY OF ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE IN THE BRAIN BUT ALSO 
IN THE EYE, THE LENS AND 
RETINA, I ENDORSE WHAT DIANE 
SAID ABOUT THE EYE. IT IS A 
WINDOW INTO THE BRAIN AND CAN 
BE CHEAPER AND EASIER ACCESS TO 
ACCESS THE BRAIN FOR PATIENTS. 
ONE POINT BEFORE DIANE EVEN 
SAID THAT IS I WANT IS A BUSY 
BIOLOGIST TO GET MORE INTO IPAC 
CELLS MENTIONED AS MODELS,  TO 
STUDY THESE MEDS. 
WHAT ABOUT MICE MODELS? 
EXPANDING MODEL AD, THAT IS 
MORE RELEVANT MOUSE MODELS, 
WILL THAT BE EXPANDED TO BRING 
DIFFERENT PATHOLOGIES TO 
DIFFERENT MOUSE MODELS?
&gt;&gt; DR. IADECOLA:
ABSOLUTELY ONE 
STANDARD WAY OF DOING IT. ONE 
INTERESTING ASPECT IS THAT 
MODELS OF PATHOLOGIES, COMING 
FROM DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES 
WHICH DO NOT NECESSARILY TALK 
TO EACH OTHER. FOR EXAMPLE AS 
YOU WILL SEE THERE IS A LOT OF 
VASCULAR PATHOLOGY BEING 
DEVELOPED IN MICE THAT WOULD BE 
WORTH CROSSING WITH MOUSE WITH 
MORE NEURODEGENERATIVE 
PATHOLOGY. AND WE NEED 
INCENTIVES TO FACILITATE THOSE 
INTERACTIONS, STARTING WITH 
EXISTING MODELS, AND MOVING 
THAT TO THE NEW MODELS AND SO 
ON. VERY IMPORTANT POINT. THANK 
YOU.
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE
LAST 
QUESTION, WE ARE TECHNICALLY 
OUT OF TIME. 
I ENCOURAGE ANYBODY ELSE TO 
PLEASE BRING YOUR QUESTIONS AND 
COMMENTS FOR FURTHER PUBLIC 
TIME THIS AFTERNOON. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU AMBER. 
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU HEAR ME?
MY NAME IS PEPAN CANN 
(PHONETIC), WORKING THIS MODEL 
IN THIS COMPANY, DEVELOPING 
AI-BASED (INDISCERNIBLE) 
TECHNOLOGY AND WORKING 
PREVIOUSLY AT THE ROCKEFELLER 
INSTITUTE (INDISCERNIBLE). 
MY QUESTION IS, WILL YOU 
CORRELATE ALL THESE BIOMARKERS?
BLOOD TESTS, SKIN TESTS, WITH 
MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY OF DEMENTIA?
&gt;&gt; DR. IADECOLA: LOOKS
LIKE 
DAVID'S NAME IS WRITTEN ON THAT 
ONE. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS WHERE YOU COME
IN. 
&gt;&gt; DR. FARDO: WE ARE
ADVOCATING 
FOR FUNDING FOR THOSE EFFORTS. 
IT IS NOT TRIVIAL.
I THINK OF THINGS IN CAUSAL 
DIAGRAMS AND DR. IADECOLA 
PRESENTED ONE ABOUT MULTIPLE 
PATHOLOGIES EFFECTIVE COGNITIVE 
DECLINE, POTENTIALLY GOING 
BACK. 
THOSE ARE ADVANCED STATISTICAL 
METHODOLOGIES THAT ARE REQUIRED 
TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER THOSE 
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. 
AND SO THE ABILITY FOR US TO 
EVEN ENTERTAIN THOSE IS 
DEPENDENT ON A COMMON 
CLASSIFICATION OR CONSENSUS 
CLASSIFICATION SO WE CAN AGAIN 
COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES. AT 
LEAST READ APPLES AND GREEN 
APPLES, RATHER THAN APPLES TO 
ORANGES. 
&gt;&gt; DR. ERTEKIN TANER:
 SORRY FOR MIGHT ADD TO THAT 
BEFORE YOU RESPOND. I THIS IS 
WHERE IS A NONPROFIT FUNDER WE 
TO GET AS MANY FUNDERS 
TOGETHER, PUBLIC/ PRIVATE 
PARTNERSHIPS AND MOVE TOWARDS 
GUARANTORS FUNDING THESE. 
&gt;&gt; USED TO SAY 
(INDISCERNIBLE)... WE 
(INDISCERNIBLE) AT THE 
ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE IN 2006. 
WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH 
MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY. WE HAVE 
AROUND (INDISCERNIBLE)... WHAT 
WE ARE DOING IN SMALL 
BUSINESSES AND SMALL COMPANIES, 
NOT CURRENT. OKAY, THIS IS FOR 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, WE ONLY 
HAVE (INDISCERNIBLE). THE REST 
IS MIXED DEMENTIA. 
BRAIN IMAGING AND 
(INDISCERNIBLE) DIFFERENT 
REGIONS. SPECIFIC TO DIFFERENT 
DISEASES FOR EXAMPLE VASCULAR 
DEMENTIA, ALZHEIMER'S OR LOU 
GEHRIG'S DISEASE. 
OR WHAT SPECIFIC AGE OF 
ETIOLOGY (INDISCERNIBLE).... 
PARTICULAR PATHOLOGY. 
WE ARE WORKING ON THAT DATA 
SET. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; IS THAT CORRECT OR NOT?
(INDISCERNIBLE)
HOW DO WE GO FOR MOLECULES?
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE DEFINITELY
HEAR 
YOUR QUESTION. 
AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR 
QUESTIONS AND THINKING. I THINK 
EVERYONE AGREES THAT IS A 
RESEARCH QUESTION THAT IS 
ACTIVELY PURSUED. WE WILL GO TO 
LUNCH RIGHT NOW AND COME BACK 
FOR AN ON-TIME START AT 12:40
EASTERN TIME. 
SO RACHEL, WE HAVE THE SLIDES
FOR LUNCH BREAK? THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; WE ARE BACK. 
DO WE HAVE OUR FIRST  SESSION 6 
PRESENTERS ONLINE?
&gt;&gt; YES WE COULD HEAR
SOMEBODY. 
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE DR. GALVIN IS
UP 
FIRST. 
&gt;&gt; DR. GALVIN: OKAY SHOULD
I 
START?
&gt;&gt; YES. I THINK IT IS SLOW
TO 
LOAD ON MY SIDE. I AM GOOD. 
WELCOME BACK EVERYBODY. 
&gt;&gt; DR. GALVIN: MY NAME IS
DR. 
JIM GALVIN, A NEUROLOGIST AT 
THE MIAMI UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF 
MEDICINE AND I AM GLAD TO 
CULTURE LIVES WITH KATHLEEN 
POSTON. 
I HAVE A BRIEF INTRODUCTION AND 
I WANT TO INTRODUCE THE 
COMMITTEE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
WONDERFUL GROUP OF TALENTED 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE MET OVER THE 
PAST SEVERAL MONTHS TO CREATE 
THIS PRESENTATION. 
I WANT TO THANK NIH AND NINDS 
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT 
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND 
PRIORITIES FOR LEWY BODY 
DEMENTIA. 
TODAY WILL COVER FOUR 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND TWO 
PRESENTERS WILL DISCUSS TWO 
PRIORITIES EACH. 
JUANTOLEDO ATUCHA WILL TALK 
ABOUT LBD CLINICAL TRIALS AND 
ELIZABETH MORMINO WILL TALK 
ABOUT BIOMARKERS, AND BRITTANY 
DUGGER WILL TALK ABOUT GENOMIC 
AND MULTI-OMICS AND ALICE 
CHEN-PLOTKIN WILL TIE ALL THIS 
TOGETHER. 
WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS WE TRY TO 
TAKE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS WE 
COULD, AND ORGANIZES INASMUCH 
OF ALOGICAL SET OF 
ACCOMMODATIONS AND PRIORITIES 
WITH ACTION PLANS, WITH 
INTERMEDIATE AND FUTURE 
LONG-TERM GOALS. 
I WILL LIKE TO TURN HER OVER TO 
DR. JUANTOLEDO ATUCHA, WHO WILL 
LEAD US TO THE FIRST SERIES OF 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
&gt;&gt; DR. TOLEDO ATUCHA: CAN
I 
HAVE MY SLIDES?
NEXT SLIDE. 
I WANT TO THANK ALL THE 
COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE 
PARTICIPATION, THOUGHTFUL IDEAS 
AND THE NIH FOR GIVING US THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS. 
ALL THE VIEWS THAT WE PRESENT 
HERE ARE FROM THE COMMITTEE 
MEMBERS AND DO NOT REFLECT THE 
OFFICIAL POLICY OF NATIONAL 
INSTITUE OF NEUROLOIGCAL 
DISORDERS AND OR THE NIH. 
I WILL TALK WITH THE FIRST AND 
SECOND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 
LEVY BODY DEMENTIA GROUP. 
THE FIRST WILL DEAL WITH 
CLINICAL TRIALS. THE MAIN 
RECOMMENDATION IS TO EXPAND THE 
LEVY BODY DEMENTIA CLINICAL 
TRIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PERFORM TRIALS THAT ALLOWS TO 
(INDISCERNIBLE) EITHER DELAYING 
OR PREVENTING THE ONSET OF 
SYMPTOMS. BUT WE AGREE IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO HAVE MEDICATIONS 
ALLEVIATED CLINICAL SYMPTOMS, 
EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT DISEASE 
MODIFYING. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
NEXT. I THOUGHT WE TOOK OUT THE 
ANIMATION. SORRY; HERE WHAT WE 
ARE SEEING ARE (INDISCERNIBLE), 
SUMMARIZING ALL THE CLINICAL 
TRIALS PERFORMED AND LEVY BODY 
DEMENTIA. 
THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN 
2022, HERE IS THE UPDATED GRAPH 
FOR 2025 SO YOU CAN SEE IN 
BLACK INK THE CURRENT NEW 
CLINICAL TRIALS FOR LEVY BODY 
DEMENTIA. AND GREY ARE THE ONES 
THAT WERE STARTED BEFORE AND 
ARE STILL ONGOING. 
THE ONES I CIRCLE HERE ARE THE 
ONES THAT RECENTLY WE READ. AND 
WE CAN SEE ON THE NEXT SLIDE 
THE RESULTS. IN THESE 
PRE-CLINIC TRIALS READ THE 
RESULTS AT THE INTERNATIONAL 
LEVY BODY DEMENTIA  CONFERENCE 
IN AMSTERDAM IN JANUARY. 
WE ARE PLEASED THE THREE OF 
THEM SHOW POSITIVE SIGNALS, TO 
DIFFERENT DEGREES, AFFECTING 
SYMPTOMS THAT WERE MOTOR, 
BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE. 
THESE WERE TRACED TO AN OVERALL 
IDEA THAT IT WILL MOVE TO 
(INDISCERNIBLE) FOR MEDICATION. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THERE HAS BEEN ALSO AN EFFORT 
TO INCREASE ON THE LEFT-HAND 
SIDE YOU SEE IMPACT IDEA, THIS 
IS A COMBINED EFFORT OF THE NIH 
AND THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION 
TO TRAIN AN INCREASE IN THE 
GENERATION OF CLINICAL TRIALS, 
RESEARCH COORDINATORS AND BRING 
SMALL COMPANIES INTO CLINICAL 
TRIALS, AND ALSO THE LEVY BODY 
DEMENTIA ASSOCIATION INCREASING 
A NETWORK OF RESEARCH CENTERS 
OF EXCELLENCE ACROSS THE UNITED 
STATES TO OFFER A CLINICAL CARE 
AND ACCESS TO CLINICAL TRIALS 
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING WITH 
LEVY BODY DEMENTIAS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
BUT WE STILL ...NEXT... NEXT... 
SO WE IDENTIFIED THERE ARE 
STILL SEVERAL GAPS. 
ONE IS THE LIMITED NUMBER OF 
LEVY BODY DEMENTIA CLINICAL 
TRIALS. 
YOU REMEMBER THE ONES IN BLACK 
WITH THE ACTIVE CLINICAL TRIALS 
AND YOU CAN COMPARE THESE TO 
THE SAME RESULTS FOR-- FOR THE 
SAME ACTIVE TRIALS FOR 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND 
PARKINSON'S DISEASE. YOU CAN 
SEE THERE ARE MANY MORE. AND 
THERE ARE LIMITED 
(INDISCERNIBLE) OF LEVY BODY 
DEMENTIA INTO CLINICAL TRIALS 
AND WE ARE LACKING LBD SPECIFIC 
CLINICAL SCALES AS PREVIOUS 
PRESENTATIONS WE NEED 
HARMONIZATION OF CLINICAL 
MEASURES, AND THERE IS A 
LIMITED INFRASTRUCTURE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
BASED ON THESE COMMENTS WE FELT 
WE NEEDED TO PROMOTE LEVY BODY 
CLINICAL TRIALS AND EXPAND THE 
FOOTPRINT AND SCOPE.  THE 
SUBJECT WILL LIKELY COME FROM 
THE MIL. 5-8 AND SECOND WE WILL 
HAVE THE DESIGN AND SELECTIONS 
BASED ON THE CLINICAL TRIALS 
AND WE WANT TO PROMOTE UPLOAD 
SELECTION OF CLINICAL TRIAL 
PARTICIPANTS ACROSS DIFFERENT 
STAGES, AND PRESENTATIONS FOR 
AT RISK GROUPS. 
BY 2029 WE LOOK FORWARD TO 
HAVING AT LEAST ONE ADDITIONAL 
AGENT TARGETING THESE 
MODIFICATIONS AT LEAST ONE PER 
PURPOSE TRACK. WE SHOULD HAVE 
REACHED TWO ADDITIONAL AGENTS 
OF DISEASE QUALIFICATIONS AND 
SYMPTOMATICAL TREATMENT 
ENTERING CLINICAL TRIALS.
TO ACHIEVE THIS WE NEED TO 
ENHANCE THE CLINICAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTING LEVY 
BODY DEMENTIA TRACK 
DEVELOPMENT.  THIS WOULD PUT AT 
THE PHASE 0 CLINICAL TRIAL 
STAGE, GET THOSE FACILITIES AND 
PERSONNEL BUT BRINGING NEW 
PEOPLE, SO WE NEED TO BRING 
INTO THE FIELD RESEARCHERS INTO 
LEVY BODY DEMENTIA. 
THERE ARE NOT THAT MANY 
VALIDATED SCALES FOR LEVY BODY 
SPECIFICALLY AND WE NEED TO 
REFINE THEM TO HAVE THE MOST 
ACCURATE CLINICAL TRIAL OUTCOME 
MEASURES. SO WE NEED THESE 
SPECIFIC SCALES THAT CAPTURE 
ALL THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS THAT 
ARE PRESENT IN LEVY BODY 
DEMENTIA.
WE ALSO NEED TO-- THIS IS 
(INDISCERNIBLE) ENHANCE OPEN 
SOURCE INFRASTRUCTURE TO AID IN 
STREAMLINING THE SHARING OF 
DATA AND SAMPLES COLLECTED IN 
CLINICAL TRIALS. 
WE NEED TO HARMONIZE AND HAVE 
GENERALIZABLE MEASURES ACROSS 
THE LBD CLINICAL TRIAL SO WE 
CAN COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES 
THE RESULTS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO HERE WE ARE GOING TO BE 
MOVING TO THE LBD COHORTS.  
HERE THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE TO 
EXPAND AND DEVELOP CLINICALLY, 
BIOLOGICALLY AND GENETICALLY 
PHENOTYPE COHORTS. AS WE SAW IN 
PRE-IS PRESENTATIONS THESE ARE 
COMPLEX PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO 
BE TACKLED FROM MULTIPLE 
ANGLES. REFILL THESE BOARDS 
WOULD REPRESENT THE USE 
POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS WILL 
HAVE LEVY BODY DEMENTIA. AND 
THIS FRAMES ON THE 
PRE-SYMPTOMATICALLY STAGES TO 
AUTOPSY. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THERE ARE SEVERAL COVERT 
LOOKING AT THIS FROM DIFFERENT 
ANGLES. ALWAYS SHOW THE RESULTS 
OF THE US LEVY BODY DEMENTIA 
CONSORTIUM SPONSORED BY NINDS. 
THERE ARE ADDITIONAL COHORTS 
LOOKING AT PARKINSON'S DISEASE; 
AND THEY ARE ADEQUATE LEGAL 
STATUS SO NINDS IS SUPPORTING 
NAPS LOOKING AT BRAIN DISORDER 
SLEEPING BEHAVIOR, WHICH IS A 
CLINICAL STAGE FOR PARKINSON'S 
AND LEVY BODY DEMENTIA. AND 
PPMI IS LOOKING AT MULTIPLE 
STAGES OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE, 
AT THE (INDISCERNIBLE), GENETIC 
COHORT SPEARHEADED BY THE -- 
FOUNDATION AND THERE WILL BE 
ADDITIONAL COHORTS THROUGH THE 
CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE NETWORK 
AND WE WILL SHOW SOME DATA 
ABOUT THAT LATER. 
THERE ARE SOME OF THE STUDIES 
OR COHORTS ABOUT MORE SPECIFIC 
ACTS. -- LOOKING AT THE 
BIOMARKERS AND FITS FOR MANY OF 
THE COHORTS WE TALKED TODAY TO 
OFFER -- (INDISCERNIBLE) AND 
GP2 IS FOCUSING ON THE GENETICS 
IN THEIR EFFORTS TO HARMONIZE 
WITH EUROPEAN COHORTS AND OTHER 
COLLEAGUES TO GET COMMON 
ELEMENTS. THIS HAS BEEN DONE IN 
THE INTERNATIONAL LEVY BODY 
DEMENTIA CONFERENCE, 2019, 
2022, 2025.
NEXT SLIDE. 
HERE I'M PRESENTING SOME 
RESULTS OF NAPS, THE 
(INDISCERNIBLE) COHORT. THE 
RECENTLY PRESENTED THE BASELINE 
DATA AND THEY ALSO SHOWED HOW 
THEY WERE ABLE TO VALIDATE AN 
RPD SPECIFIC SKILL THAT CAN BE 
USED IN CLINICAL TRIALS AND 
CLINICAL PRACTICE ALSO THE 
PPMI, HAS BEEN A RECENT 
IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME 
BIOMARKERS THAT WILL BE 
PRESENTED LATER THAT HELP WITH 
THE BIOLOGICAL DEFINITIONS OF 
LEVY BODY DISEASE ALTHOUGH WE 
ARE FINDING THAT THERE ARE SOME 
CLINICAL SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE 
WILL HOW THE INTERACTION 
ANALOGIES THAT AFFECT 
CORRELATION WITH BIOMARKERS AND 
THE OVERALL RESULTS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND THE US LBD CONSORTIUM WILL 
EVALUATE THE (INDISCERNIBLE), 
AND HOW PREVALENT THE 
BIOMARKERS ARE. AND WE KNOW 
THEY AFFECT THE CLINICAL 
PROGRESSION AND IT WILL BE 
IMPORTANT FOR THE DESIGN OF 
CLINICAL TRIALS IN DLB FOR HALF 
OF THE PEOPLE THEY EVALUATE THE 
BIOLOGICAL DEFINITION OF 
BIOMARKERS...
&gt;&gt; TWO MINUTES..
&gt;&gt; DR. TOLEDO ATUCHA:
THANK 
YOU.  WE RECEIVED OVER 6000 
PEOPLE WERE EVALUATED FOR 
DIFFERENT DEMENTIAS. 500 OF 
THEM HAVE LEVY BODY DEMENTIA, 
BUT FROM THIS GROUP LESSON 1/4 
HAD LDB SKILLS. 
CLINICAL SCALES. WE NEED THESE 
COHORT SO THEY CAN FEED THE 
NEXT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL 
BE PRESENTED. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO, OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO 
EXPAND AND DEVELOP A COHORT 
THAT ENCOMPASSES ALL THE STAGES.
 WE WANT MORE FREQUENT 
ASSESSMENT.  AND WE ALSO THINK 
THE DIGITAL TOOLS AND BIO FLUID 
COLLECTION WILL BE HELPFUL TO 
GET MORE TESTING, THIS WILL 
HELP THE RECOMMENDATIONS 3-5.  
WE THINK THAT THIS PARTICIPANT 
IN THE STUDY SHOULD BROADLY 
REPRESENT US INDIVIDUALS LIVING 
WITH (INDISCERNIBLE). 
NEXT SLIDE. 
WE WILL NEED PHENOTYPING OF 
CRITICAL MEASURES.  BUT WE ALSO 
WANT TO INCLUDE MEASURES THAT 
INCLUDE (INDISCERNIBLE), 
COMORBIDITY CONDITIONS AND 
CO-PATHOLOGIES AND DIGITAL BIO 
MARKERS, WE NEED TO TRAIN 
WORKFORCE WITH THE DIFFERENT 
SKILLS AND EXPAND THE SCOPE OF 
RESEARCH ON THE PROBLEM THAT IS 
AVAILABLE THAT WE HAVE SHOWN IS 
VERY REDUCED. 
AND THE COMMON TOPIC TODAY, 
HARMONIZATION OF DATA IS 
NECESSARY ACROSS THE COHORT.  
WE NEED TO DEVELOP GUIDELINES 
TO HARMONIZE STUDIES AND 
FACILITATE COMPARISONS. 
NEXT I WILL GIVE THE PODIUM TO 
DR. MORMINO TO TALK ABOUT 
BIOMARKERS. 
&gt;&gt; DR. MORMINO: THANK YOU
I AM 
FROM THE COMMITTEE THAT DO NOT 
REFLECT THE POLICY OF THE 
NATIONAL INSTITUE OF 
NEUROLOIGCAL DISORDERS AND 
STROKE OR NIH. 
IN THE SPACE BIOMARKERS THAT 
CAPTURE HALLMARK DISEASE 
PATHOLOGIES AND THE PROGRESSION 
OF THESE PATHOLOGIES HAVE BEEN 
CRITICAL FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING 
OF THE NATURAL HISTORY OF 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. 
THIS BIOMARKER WORK HAS ALSO 
BEEN CRITICAL FOR CLINICAL 
TRIAL DESIGN IN THE AD SPACE. 
THIS INCLUDES BOTH ENROLLMENT 
OF INDIVIDUALS INTO TRIALS, 
STRATIFICATION OF ANALYSES, AND 
ALSO ASSESSMENT OF DISEASE 
MODIFICATION. 
AND VERY RECENTLY IN THE AD 
SPACE WE ARE SEEING THESE 
BIOMARKERS USED IN THE ACTUAL 
CLINICAL CONTEXT FOR DECISIONS 
SURROUNDING ANTI-AMYLOID 
THERAPIES. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
YEAH, IN PARALLEL TO THESE AD 
EFFORTS MULTIPLE RECENT 
FRAMEWORKS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED 
IN THE LEVY BODY SPACE 
HIGHLIGHTING OPPORTUNITIES TO 
LEVERAGE BOTH DISEASE SPECIFIC 
BIOMARKERS AND BIOMARKERS OF 
PROGRESSION TO UNDERSTAND LEVY 
BODY PROGRESSION AND CLINICAL 
DESIGN IN RESEARCH CONTEXT. 
THIS FORMS THE BACKGROUND FOR 
THE TWO RECOGNITIONS I'M GOING 
TO GO OVER. RECOMMENDATION 3 IS 
FOCUSED ON DIAGNOSTIC 
BIOMARKERS, DISEASE SPECIFIC TO 
REFINE AND VALIDATE EXISTING 
BIOMARKERS IN THIS CONTEXT AND 
ALSO DEVELOP NEW BIOMARKERS 
RELATED TO ACTUAL LEVY BODY 
PATHOLOGY. 
AND ALSO APPLY THESE BIOMARKERS 
IN THE CONTEXT OF MULTIPLE 
ETIOLOGY DEMENTIA. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO WE HAVE SEEN TRULY 
REMARKABLE BREAKTHROUGHS 
RECENTLY IN THE FIELD, WITH THE 
SUCCESS OF ROBUST BIOMARKERS 
MEASURING ALPHA (PHONETIC) 
NUCLEI PATHOLOGY IN VIVO, 
AVAILABLE FOR SPINAL FLUID AND 
SKIN BIOPSIES HIGHLY SPECIFIC 
INITIAL VERY GOOD SENSITIVITY 
TO UNDERLYING PATHOLOGY. 
PAVING THE WAY FOR IMMEDIATE 
OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO 
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND 
EARLY DETECTION OF THESE 
PATHOLOGIES IN VIVO. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO THIS LEADS DIRECTLY INTO OUR 
RECOMMENDATION.  WE ARE VERY 
EXCITED ABOUT THESE CURRENT 
BIOMARKERS. 
ONE OF THE MAIN LIMITATIONS IS 
THAT THEY PROVIDE ONLY A BINARY 
READOUT, YES/NO MEASURE FOR THE 
MOST PART.  SO THAT IS ONE 
RECOMMENDATION, TO BE ABLE TO 
GET MORE OF A CONTINUUM OF 
DISEASE, RELATED TO ALPHA 
NUCLEUS DEPOSITION. 
AND THESE BIOMARKERS OBVIOUSLY 
DO NOT TELL US WHERE IN THE 
BRAIN THE A-SYNUCLEIN IS 
DEPOSIT AND THEY ARE CURRENTLY 
MULTIPLE EFFORTS UNDERWAY WE 
ARE SEEING EXCITING PROGRESS, 
NEURAL A-SYNUCLEIN  INCLUSIONS 
AND ANOTHER RECOGNITION RELATED 
TO THESE RECENT ADVANCEMENTS 
ARE DISCLOSURE PROTOCOLS 
THEMSELVES. THE ABILITY TO 
ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE THESE 
RESULTS, THESE A-SYNUCLEIN 
POSITIVE RESULTS BACK TO OUR 
RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS.  AND SO 
THIS IS A NEW OPPORTUNITY IN 
THESE PROTOCOLS. THEY NEEDED TO 
BE DEVELOPED AND BETTER 
UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF THE 
RESEARCH PROTOCOLS THAT WE HAVE 
THESE BINARY OPS AVAILABLE TO 
US. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
TO MOVING ON TO RECOMMENDATION 
NUMBER 4. 
SO HERE WE ARE FOCUSED ON OTHER 
PROCESSES AND MECHANISMS THAT 
ARE RELEVANT FOR LEVY BODY 
PROGRESSION BEYOND THESE 
BIOMARKER READOUTS OF THE 
DISEASE ITSELF. 
AND THIS IS CENTERED AROUND THE 
DEVELOPMENT OR REFINEMENT OF 
BIOMARKERS RELATED TO MANY 
DIFFERENT PROCESSES THAT WE 
FEEL ARE IMPORTANT AND THIS 
INCLUDES NEURAL INJURY AND 
NEURO TRANSMITTERS AND 
NEURODEGENERATION, THAT ARE 
BOTH PREDICTIVE AND PROGNOSTIC 
OF THE DISEASE, IMPORTANTLY 
PROVIDE MONITORING TO TRACK THE 
ACTUAL PROGRESSION OF THE 
DISEASE. 
THESE BIOMARKERS WILL ALSO 
ALLOW US TO BETTER IDENTIFY 
WHETHER TARGETING ENGAGEMENT IS 
HAPPENING IN THE CONTEXT OF 
THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS AS 
WELL. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO HERE-- THIS IS A VERY BROAD 
RECOMMENDATION, AND REALLY 
CRITICAL.  THERE IS A LOT OF 
WORK TO BE DONE SO WE HAVE A 
FAIR AMOUNT OF DETAILED 
RECOMMENDATIONS TO FILL THIS 
GOAL. 
I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH THEM 
ONE AT A TIME HERE. 
SO AS I SAID, WE HAVE THESE 
REALLY GREAT MARKERS FOR 
A-SYNUCLEIN RIGHT NOW, BUT THE 
OTHER PROCESSES THAT NEED TO BE 
MEASURED IN TERMS OF 
BIOMARKERS, SO WE NEED TO 
IDENTIFY A NUMBER OF PATHWAYS 
HERE, SYNAPTIC, LYSOSOMAL, 
MITOCHONDRIAL, IMMUNOLOGIC AND 
OTHER PROCESSES RELATED TO 
A-SYNUCLEIN PATHOLOGY, 
DIFFERENT THAN THE PATHOLOGICAL 
CONCLUSION THEMSELVES. 
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK IN THE 
NEUROTRANSMITTER SPACE, AND 
THESE TOOLS ARE OPPORTUNITIES 
TO FURTHER REFINE THEM AND 
IMPROVE UPON THEM.  THIS IS 
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN WIDELY 
IMPLEMENTED IN THE LEVY BODY 
SPACE AND THERE IS ALSO 
INTEREST IN DEGENERATIVE 
CHANGES AND THESE CAN BE 
MEASURED WITH BIO FLUIDS AND 
ALSO MR TOOLS LOOKING FOR 
INSTANCE AT MELANIN, MRI, AND 
ION SENSITIVE MRI. 
WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE 
SORT OF DISCOVERY OF NEW 
BIOMARKERS SHOULD INCLUDE A 
BROAD TYPES OF POTENTIAL 
SAMPLES. AND SO BLOOD, CSS, 
SKIN, COLON, IMAGING FRONT, 
DIFFERENT MODALITIES AND WE ARE 
IN THE SPACE WE WANT TO EXPLORE 
THE FULL RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES 
HERE. 
THERE SHOULD ALSO BE THESE 
BIOMARKERS, THEY REALLY SHOULD 
BE A CONNECTION BETWEEN BOTH 
THE HUMAN WORK AND ALSO MODEL 
SYSTEMS. 
WE THINK THAT CONNECTION IS 
QUITE IMPORTANT FOR THESE NOVEL 
DISCOVERIES. 
THERE'S ALSO IMPERILED TO THESE 
BIOLOGICAL MARKERS, A LOT OF 
INTEREST IN THESE MORE DIGITAL 
APPROACHES AS WELL. 
NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL. LOTS OF 
IDEAS AROUND THIS. HERE WE ARE 
LISTING SOMEWHAT OF A LAUNDRY 
LIST OF THESE POTENTIAL 
PATHWAYS, WEARABLES, TSG, 
COMPUTERIZED TESTING INVERSE 
APPROACHES TO HOME-BASED 
MONITORING TO CAPTURE 
ECOLOGICALLY VALID MEASUREMENTS 
ON OUR PARTICIPANTS. WITH ALL 
OF THESE THERE NEEDS TO BE 
ATTENTION TO SCALABILITY AND 
ACCESSIBILITY AS WE VALIDATE 
THESE. 
GIVEN THE SCOPE OF THIS FEEL 
THERE SHOULD BE WORKSHOPS AND 
COORDINATED EFFORTS TO ADDRESS 
FEASIBILITY, AND IMPLEMENTATION 
OF THESE TOOLS AND ALSO DATA 
SHARING AS WELL. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
A FEW MORE RECOMMENDATIONS 
HERE. SO FOR ALL THE BIOMARKERS 
I JUST MENTIONED, THE CONTEXT 
OF USE IS QUITE IMPORTANT SO 
THESE BIOMARKERS, WILL THEY BE 
USED TO DEFINE FUTURE 
PROGRESSION AND RISK?
WILL THERE BE USED TO MONITOR 
SYMPTOMS IN THE CONTEXT OF 
CLINICAL TRIALS?
FOCUS IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN 
MIND FOR BIOMARKER DISCOVERY 
IMPORTANTLY THESE BIOMARKERS 
WILL BE CRITICAL TO ESTABLISH 
THAT THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH 
CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL SIGNS AND 
SYMPTOMS THAT WE ARE INTERESTED 
IN IN THE CONTEXT OF LBD. THERE 
IS A GENERAL SENTIMENT THAT 
DISTAL DISCOVERY MIGHT BENEFIT 
FROM COORDINATING MULTISITE BIO 
MARKER STUDIES WITH A BROAD 
RANGE OF EXPERTISE INCLUDED IN 
THESE STUDIES, SPANNING 
CLINICAL BIOMARKER, 
NEUROPATHIC, STATISTICAL 
EXPERTISE. 
AND WHAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
WOULD DO IT WOULD ALLOW US TO 
BUILD BIGGER COHORTS AND WE 
HEARD ABOUT THAT IN THE LAST 
SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS. IT WILL 
ALLOW US TO COLLECT HARMONIZED 
DATA ACROSS THE LARGER COHORTS, 
AND SYNCHRONIZE THOSE EFFORTS. 
IT WILL ALSO REALLY PROMOTE 
BROADER DATA SHARING.  THERE 
WAS A FEELING THAT IF SOMETHING 
LIKE THIS WERE TO TAKE PLACE, 
DIGITAL MARKERS SHOULD ALSO BE 
INCLUDED. BUT INDEPENDENT OF 
THIS THERE IS ALSO A FAIR 
AMOUNT OF DATA THAT IS ALREADY 
OUT THERE.  AND ALSO APPROACHES 
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS DATA 
THAT ALREADY EXISTS, USING 
POSTACQUISITION HARMONIZATION 
PROTOCOLS. AND HERE IS THE 
EXAMPLE OF ...
&gt;&gt; TWO MINUTES...
&gt;&gt; THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A
STUDY THAT COULD BE 
IMPLEMENTED, MULTIPLE PET 
SCANS, PERHAPS MRI SEQUENCE TO 
GET AT THESE BRAIN STEM CHANGES 
IN OF COURSE IN BIO FLUID DATA 
AS WELL. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO SOME COMMON NEEDS ACROSS 
BOTH, RECOMMENDATIONS I 
DISCUSSED SO THE COHORTS ARE 
REALLY CRITICAL FOR THIS. I 
JUST TALKED ABOUT SPECIFICALLY 
THE MULTISITE STUDY, BUT THERE 
ARE DIFFERENT FLAVORS WHERE 
EXISTING OR NEW COHORTS COULD 
BE ESTABLISHED INTEGRATE THESE 
DIFFERENT BIOMARKERS. 
AND THERE SHOULD BE A DOCTOR 
DOOLITTLE COMPONENT TO LOOK AT 
THE PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE. 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT 
POSTMORTEM COMPARISONS, ALSO 
ESSENTIAL TO VALIDATE THESE 
BIOMARKERS.  AND THE ABILITY TO 
ALSO LOOK AT THESE BIOMARKERS 
IN THE CONTEXT OF MIXED 
PATHOLOGIES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT. 
THERE IS ALSO A GENERAL 
CONSENSUS THAT WE SHOULD BE 
TARGETING ALL STAGES OF THE 
DISEASE. THE DISEASE INCLUDES 
MULTIPLE CLINICAL PHASES, 
STARTING WITH ASYMPTOMATIC 
PHASE. BY TRANSITIONING INTO 
SYMPTOMATIC AND THESE 
BIOMARKERS WILL LIKELY HAVE 
DIFFERENT ROLES AND MEANING AT 
DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE 
DISEASE.  IT WILL BE IMPORTANT 
TO INCLUDE THE BROAD RANGE OF 
ACTUAL STAGES WITH THE DISEASE. 
AND OF COURSE MANY OF THE 
MARKERS I MENTIONED, THEY ARE 
NOT THE MOST SCALABLE THEY USED 
TO BE AN EYE ON MEASURES THAT 
ARE NONINVASIVE AND SCALABLE AS 
WELL.
 I'M GOING TO PASS IT OVER TO 
DR. DUGGER FOR THE NEXT SET OF 
MILESTONES. THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; DR. DUGGER: THANK YOU
ALL.  
CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY?
OKAY THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING 
YOUR TIME.  YOU TOOK TIME OUT 
OF YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE TO ATTEND 
TODAY, AND TO PROVIDE THIS 
CRITICAL FEEDBACK ON THESE 
PROPOSED RECOMMENDATIONS AND 
PRIORITIES. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
EVEN THOUGH YOU SEE MY FACE I 
WILL BE PRESENTING ON THE 
GENETICS OR OMICS OF THE LEVY 
BODY DISEASE AND PINCHHITTING 
TODAY FOR DOCTOR SONJA SCHOLZ,  
AND THESE ARE THE DISCLAIMERS. 
THESE ARE THE REGULATIONS 
RELATED TO THE OMICS ASPECT AND 
THE FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS OF THE 
LEVY BODY DISEASE CONTRIBUTING 
TO THE ONSET AND PROGRESSION OF 
LEVY BODY DISEASE USING 
CHARACTERIZATION AND ANALYSIS 
TO SUPPORT DRUG DISCOVERY. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO, WITH THIS SLIDE, THIS IS 
KIND OF SHOWING GENETICS ALONG 
WITH BROADER MULTI-OMICS 
TECHNOLOGIES AND THEY HAVE 
PROVIDED UNPRECEDENTED 
OPPORTUNITIES TO DECODE LEVY 
BODY DEMENTIA AND THIS IS JUST 
A BRIEF HISTORY OF WHERE WE ARE 
AT TODAY. 
IS VERY EXCITING TO SEE THESE 
ADVANCES FOR OUR ABILITY TO 
TACKLE THIS CHALLENGING 
DISEASE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
IN RECOMMENDATION NUMBER 5, WE 
ARE PARTICULARLY EMPHASIZING 
WITH THIS RECENT PROGRESS HOW 
COMPLEX THINGS ARE.  SO WE HAVE 
THE STRUCTURAL VARIANTS. THERE 
HAS BEEN A X-CHROMOSOMAL 
VARIANCE AS WELL AS EPIGENETICS 
AND TRANSCRIPTOMICS, IMPORTANT 
TO MEET THIS DISEASE. 
IN THE ANALYSIS ASPECT WE ARE 
IN THE AGE OF BIG DATA AND 
COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS FOR 
NOVEL INSIGHTS ON THESE 
DISEASES.  AND AGAIN THESE ARE 
JUST BRIEF, BRIEF OUTLINES. THE 
HAS BEEN SO MUCH WORK IN THE 
SPACE AND AGAIN TRYING TO 
HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THAT. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND WHEN IT COMES TO DATA AND 
BIO SPECIMEN PLATFORMS, THERE 
HAVE BEEN A LOT OF GREAT 
PLATFORMS THAT ARE OUT IN THE 
FIELD. AND YOU CAN SEE HERE 
WITH NICRA AND PD, BP AND SOME 
OTHERS THAT HAVE GREATLY 
ADVANCE THE FIELD. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
EVEN THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN 
THESE GREAT ADVANCES, AND I 
KNOW I WANT TO SO MUCH WORK IN 
SUCH A BRIEF AMOUNT OF TIME, WE 
ARE STILL MISSING HERITABILITY, 
MULTI-OMICS AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
DATA INTEGRATION EXTEND RISK OF 
MULTIGENERATIONAL GENETIC 
RISKS, AS WELL AS CELL TYPE IN 
TISSUE SPECIFIC CONTEXT OF 
GENETIC RISK. 
LARGELY DEEP PHENOTYPE COHORTS 
WITH MULTI-OMIC DATA AS WELL AS 
GENOMIC DATA FROM COHORTS 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BROADER 
US POPULATION.  AND A LOT OF 
THESE THEMES IF YOU HAVE BEEN 
ATTENDING MULTIPLE SESSIONS 
HAVE BEEN THROUGHOUT A LOT OF 
THESE SESSIONS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO BASED ON THESE GAPS, AGAIN 
OUR RECOMMENDATION 5, IS TO 
INTEGRATE FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS 
OF LEVY BODY DISEASE BY THE 
GENETIC -- CONTRARY TO THE 
ONSET PROGRESSION OF LEVY BODY 
DISEASE AND SUPPORTING DRUG 
DISCOVERY, AND THE ANIMATIONS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO WE WANTED TO DISCOVER AND 
REPLICATE GENETIC AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
WE ALSO WANT TO INTEGRATE 
GENOMICS IN DEEPLY PHENOTYPE 
COHORTS. 
FUNCTIONALIZED THESE RISK 
VARIANCE INTO MECHANISMS, 
TARGETS AND BIOMARKERS. AGAIN 
THIS IS JUST REPEATING A LOT OF 
THE STUFF, MAKING SURE THAT THE 
MESSAGE IS GETTING ACROSS OF 
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS INVESTING 
IN MOLECULAR HETEROGENEITY 
ACROSS LEVY BODY DISEASE AND 
RELATED DISORDERS, PRIORITIZING 
INNOVATIVE ANALYTICS DATA 
PLATFORMS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO NOW I'M GOING TO BE MOVING 
INTO THE NEUROPATHIC PORTION IN 
THESE ARE MY DISCLOSURES AND 
DISCLAIMERS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THIS IS RECOMMENDATION NUMBER 
6. WE WANT TO HARMONIZE 
TECHNIQUES NOT STANDARDIZE, 
BECAUSE A LOT OF COHORTS AND 
RESOURCES ALREADY EXIST,  WE 
DON'T WANT TO NEGATE THOSE FOR 
THE NEURAL PATHOLOGICAL 
CHARACTERIZATION OF LEVY BODY 
DISEASE WERE USING WELL 
CHARACTERIZED REPRESENTATIVE 
LEVY BODY COHORTS AND YOU CAN 
SEE THE DESCRIPTION BENEATH, 
TRYING TO HAVE MORE DETAILS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND SO WITH RESPECT TO RECENT 
PROGRESS, IT IS ALWAYS GOOD TO 
KIND OF BENCHMARK. AND SO HERE 
ARE SOME OF THE DISEASES WE ARE 
COVERING IN THIS SUMMIT. 
YOU CAN SEE ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE, BASIC JUST USING THE 
SEARCH TERM "NEUROPATHOLOGY," 
AND THEN THE SPECIFIC TERMS 
EITHER LEVY BODY , DISEASE 
ALZHEIMER'S, CEREBROVASCULAR, 
TDP-43. 
 WITHOUT A SURPRISE YOU CAN 
SEEALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
NEUROPATHOLOGY WINS BY FAR. NOW 
ALMOST 700 APPLICATIONS 
(CORRECTION) PUBLICATIONS A 
YEAR AND THAT FAR OUTWEIGHS TDP 
AND LEVY BODY SHOWN HERE DOWN 
ON THIS GRAPH, IT VERY MUCH 
REMAINS CONSTANT. PRETTY MUCH 
ON PAR WITH TDP-43 
NEUROPATHOLOGY. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND SO SOME OF THE PROGRESS 
THAT HAS BEEN MADE AND AGAIN 
EVEN THOUGH WE WERE TALKING IN 
THE DECISIONS ABOUT BIOMARKERS, 
A LOT OF THOSE BIOMARKERS 
CANNOT HAPPEN WITHOUT THE 
NEUROPATHOLOGY SO THE TITLE OF 
THE SLIDE IS, RECENT PROGRESS 
THAT LBD YOUR PATHOLOGY 
INFORMING BIOMARKER STUDIES, 
AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE 
PAPERS THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED 
SINCE THE LAST SUMMIT. 
AS WELL AS THERE HAVE BEEN 
EFFORTS IN HARMONIZATION, 
ESPECIALLY WITH THE 12 MEASURES 
ACROSS SIX COMMUNITY-BASED 
AUTOPSY COHORTS OF DEMENTIA. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
ONE STUDY TO HIGHLIGHT EVEN 
THOUGH I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A 
LOT OF OTHER SLIDES, IS THE 
RECENT CENTER WITHOUT WALLS FOR 
LEVY BODY DEMENTIA. AND THANK 
YOU TO DR. PAM MACLEAN FOR 
PROVIDING THE BASIS FOR THIS 
SLIDE. 
THIS IS VERY NICE BECAUSE 
NEUROPATHOLOGY IS AT THE HEART 
OF THIS GRANT, AND USING THE 
NEUROPATHOLOGY AND WORKING IN 
THE OMICS ASPECTS IN THE 
FUNCTIONAL PRESENCE USING THESE 
RESOURCES. I AM VERY EXCITED 
FOR THESE PROJECTS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN AGAIN 
RECENT PROGRESS, THERE ARE 
STILL GAPS.  AND THESE TEAMS 
HAVE BEEN THROUGHOUT THIS NINDS 
SUMMIT ABOUT HARMONIZING 
TECHNIQUES; LOOPING SCIENTIST 
TO SAMPLES AND DATA IN 
USER-FRIENDLY PORTALS AS WELL 
AS DIGITAL AND IMAGE ANALYSIS 
AND THE LEARNING TECHNIQUES AND 
LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS 
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF DEEPLY 
PHENOTYPE AUTOPSY COHORTS 
FOCUSED ON LBD.
AND WHEN I SAY FOCUSED ON LEVY 
BODY, ALLOW THE DATA THAT WE 
SEE COMING OUT SPECIALLY THANK 
YOU TO DOCTOR TOLEDO PRESENTING 
FOR SOME OF THE THINGS OF THE 
LEVY BODY COHORTS BUT A LOT OF 
THE WORK BEING DONE IS BASED ON 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE CENTER 
COHORTS THERE IS NOT A LOT OF 
SPECIFIC LEVY BODY COHORTS AND 
PLEASE FORGIVE MY LANGUAGE, IT 
IS ALMOST LIKE AN AFTERTHOUGHT 
OR CAPITALIZATION SOME OF THE 
EXISTING COHORTS RELATED TO 
WORK ON THE BODY DISEASE. I SAY 
THAT VERY LIKELY NOT TO BE 
PROVOCATIVE, BUT TO MAKE PEOPLE 
AWARE OF THE SITUATION. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND SO, WITH THOSE GAPS-- AND 
IF YOU CAN MAYBE HIT A WHOLE 
BUNCH BECAUSE THE ANIMATIONS ON 
THIS GOT A LITTLE JUMBLED. 
THANK YOU. HIT A WHOLE BUNCH 
UNTIL EVERYTHING POPS UP AND I 
WILL LET YOU KNOW. 
YEAH IT GOT A LITTLE JUMBLED. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. 
STOP THERE. THANK YOU.
A RECOMMENDATION IS TO ENHANCE 
AND HARMONIZE THE TECHNIQUES 
FOR NEURAL PATHOLOGICAL 
CHARACTERIZATION OF LEVY BODY  
DISEASE AND USE OF LEVY BODY 
PATHOLOGY COHORTS AND THE 
ENHANCED PRACTICE FOR YOUR 
PATHOLOGICAL VALUATION AND 
DEVELOP SCALABLE METHODS FOR 
ASSESSING LEVY BODY ASSOCIATED 
PATHOLOGY AND CAPITALIZING ON 
THOSE EXISTING HUMAN TISSUE 
RESOURCES. 
INCREASING AUTOPSIES OF PERSONS 
WHO MAY DEVELOP OR ALREADY HAVE 
DEVELOPED LEVY BODY DISEASE AND 
ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE-- AND I 
LOVE THE COMMENT ABOUT THE EYES 
IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION AND SO 
THIS PERIPHERAL TISSUE SAMPLES, 
BECAUSE THE BRAIN IS CONNECTED 
TO THE BODY AND SOMETIMES 
THAT'S SKULL IS VERY HARD TO 
GET TO. 
I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS IN 
PRIOR SESSIONS RELATED TO THAT. 
AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS A 
PORTAL LINKING TISSUE 
RESOURCES, MOLECULAR, CLINICAL, 
IMAGING AND BIOMARKER DATA. AND 
I THINK THAT IS IT. THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; SO, ... MY NAME IS
ALICE 
CHEN-PLOTKIN, PHYSICIAN 
SCIENTIST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
I WILL BE ROUNDING OUT THE LAST 
TWO RECOMMENDATION FROM A 
WORKGROUP.  THESE ARE THE 
DISCLAIMERS AND DISCLOSURES. 
NOT MUCH EXCITING THERE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO, I'M JUST BEGINNING BY 
COMING RIGHT TO THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS. RECOMMENDATION 
7, PRIORITY 1, , TO DEVELOP 
MODELS PATHOGENESIS AND 
MECHANISMS OF TOXICITY, AND 
NORMAL MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR 
FUNCTIONS OF A-SYNUCLEIN WITH 
THE AIM OF SUPPORTING DRUG 
DISCOVERY. 
THE RECOMMENDATION I WILL COVER 
IS NUMBER 8, WHICH WE ASSIGN 
PRIORITY 4. 
TO IDENTIFY THEM MULTIPLE 
ETIOLOGY MECHANISMS OF 
SELECTIVE VULNERABILITY, 
DISEASE HETEROGENEITY, DISEASE 
SPREAD/ PROPAGATION, AND 
INTERACTION WITH OTHER 
AGE-RELATED PATHOLOGIES AS 
THERAPEUTIC TARGETS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO I WILL BEGIN BY KIND OF 
COVERING THE PROGRESS SINCE THE 
LAST SUMMIT IN 2022. 
I WILL DIVIDE THIS INTO WHAT WE 
HAVE LEARNED ABOUT A-SYNUCLEIN 
WHICH IS A LOT.  I CANNOT 
EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH-- I AM NOT 
COVERING THAT HAS BEEN DONE 
SINCE 2022, THE BASIS FOR OUR 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND 11 HAS ONE 
THING, WHICH IS THIS IS A VERY 
EXCITING TIME  FOR THE LEVY 
BODY DISEASES, AND SUPPORT OF 
THESE RESEARCH EFFORTS IS VERY 
IMPORTANT. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO IF YOU THINK THAT HAVE BEEN 
LEARNED. IN 2022-- AND THIS IS 
HAPPENING ALL THE TIME-- 
(INDISCERNIBLE) SHOWING US THAT 
THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT 
CONFIRMATION SHAPES IN LEVY 
BODY DEMENTIA  IN LEVY BODY 
DISEASE AND PARKINSON'S 
DISEASE, VERSUS MULTIPLE 
SYSTEMS ATROPHY WHICH IS ALSO 
IS SYSTEMS ATROPHY FOR 
INCLUSION DATA. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THIS IS THE BASIS, THE 
DIFFERENCE IN CONFIRMATION AND 
MAY BE THE BASIS FOR WHAT 
SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS 
A BIOMARKER TEST THAT HAS BEEN 
SHOWN IN PREVIOUS SLIDES. AND 
SO THIS IS THE PAPER FROM 
NATURE 2020, THAT ESSENTIALLY 
SHOWS THAT IN THE ABILITY TO 
SEE IMPLICATION IN A-SYNUCLEIN, 
IN SAMPLES OF PARKINSON&#x2019;S 
DISEASE SAMPLES, RELATED TO THE 
CONFIRMATION OF A-SYNUCLEIN. 
THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN 
TRANSLATED IN THIS PERIOD OF 
TIME INTO AN FDA AVAILABLE 
CLINICAL TESTS.  THIS IS THE 
TECHNOLOGY RECORDED IN 2020 AND 
NOW SHOWN AND THIS IS THE SAME 
SEED AMPLIFICATION ASSAY SHOWN 
IN PREVIOUS SLIDES THAT LOOKED 
AT HOW THE SEED AMPLIFICATION 
ASSAY PERFORMED IN MANY 
PATIENTS.
AND AS YOU CAN SEE DEPENDING ON 
HOW YOU DEFINE PARKINSON'S 
DISEASE, DIFFERENT GENETIC 
MUTATIONS, THE SENSITIVITIES 
ARE VERY, VERY HIGH. WHICH IS 
BASICALLY WHY THIS IS NOW A 
DIAGNOSTIC TEST THAT A DOCTOR 
CAN ORDER IN THE CLINIC. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO EVEN THOUGH WE LEARNED A LOT 
ABOUT THE CONFIRMATIONS, 
THERE'S A LOT MORE TO LEARN SO 
I'M HIGHLIGHTING A FEW THINGS. 
IT TURNS OUT THAT WORK FROM -- 
AND OTHERS SHOW THE 
POST-TRANSLATIONAL 
MODIFICATIONS IN A-SYNUCLEIN, 
WORK DONE IN MSA LBD IN NORMAL 
BRAINS AS WELL AND YOU CAN SEE 
WITH THE DIFFERENTIATE THAT THE 
POST TRANSLATION MODIFICATIONS 
ARE LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT 
DEPENDING ON THE STUDY. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT ONE 
PHOSPHORYLATION ON SERIN 129 
WHICH IS LONG BEEN FOUND TO BE 
A HALLMARK OF LEVY BODY 
PATHOLOGY IS WHAT WE FIND IN 
THE BRAINS OF PEOPLE WITH LEVY 
BODY DISEASE AND IT TURNS OUT 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PAPER ONE 
THING THAT IS INTERESTING IS 
THAT THIS PHOSPHORYLATION IS 
FOUND IN NORMAL PEOPLE. AND 
PROVOCATIVE WORK FROM -- LAB, 
SHOWED THAT MAYBE THIS 
PHOSPHORYLATION HAS A 
PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTION.
NEXT SLIDE. 
ANOTHER THING THAT BASICALLY I 
WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT THE 
REASON THAT THESE DISEASES 
CHANGE OVER TIME, THE REASON 
PATIENTS PROGRESS OVER TIME IS 
THE PATHOLOGY SHOWING THAT IT 
SPREADS FROM ONE AREA OF THE 
BRAIN TO ANOTHER PART OF THE 
BRAIN LIKE IN PARKINSON'S 
DISEASE AT START OF THE TREMOR 
AND THEN IT STARTS TO DEVELOP 
OTHER DISEASES, AND THE SPREAD 
OF PATHOLOGY FROM CELL TO CELL. 
OTHER THINGS BESIDE THE 
NUCLEON, BUT THIS IS AT LEAST 
ONE CORE FEATURE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THIS IS WORK FROM OUR LAB THAT 
BASICALLY HAS BEEN TRYING TO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE 
DETERMINANTS OF THE SPREAD FROM 
CELL TO CELL PATHOLOGY. 
IT TURNS OUT THAT ONE OF THE 
GENES THAT CAME OUT OF THESE 
BIG GENOMICS PARKINSON DISEASE 
-- BELONGS TO A GENE CALLED 
GPNMB. 
IT APPEARS THAT NEURONS CAN NO 
LONGER TAKE UP THIS 
PATHOLOGICAL NUCLEON, MAY BE 
KEY TO THE SPREAD. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO, ANOTHER THING WE WANTED TO 
EMPHASIZE IN THIS CAN HAPPEN 
MULTIPLE SESSIONS BEFORE. 
EVEN THOUGH I BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT A-SYNUCLEIN, AND WHAT WE 
HAVE LEARNED ABOUT A-SYNUCLEIN, 
IN THE BRAIN A-SYNUCLEIN IS NOT 
BY ITSELF.  AND SO WE WILL SHOW 
YOU THE CLINICAL CASES FROM A 
LIVE STUDY. AND WHAT YOU CAN 
SEE IS THAT YELLOW PART -- THE 
RED PART IS JUST LEVY BODY 
DISEASE AND THOSE BRAINS. THE 
RED PLUS ORANGES LEVY BODY 
DISEASE PATHOLOGY PLUS A NORMAL 
CHANGES YOU EXPECT WITH AGING. 
THE YELLOW AND THE -- IS 
BASICALLY NEURODEGENERATIVE 
DISEASE, LEVY BODY DISEASES IN 
AGING IN ANOTHER PATHOLOGY. YOU 
CAN SEE THAT ABOUT ONE THIRD OF 
CLINICAL LBD CASES HAVE 
ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGIES. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE PATTERNS 
OF CO-PATHOLOGY, THE OTHER 
TYPES OF PATHOLOGY PROTEINS IN 
THE BRAIN WITH THE LEVY BODIES  
MAY RELATE TO THIS ORDER OF 
SPREAD OF REGIONS AFFECTED BY 
A-SYNUCLEIN PATHOLOGY. 
SO THESE ARE BASED ON KIND OF 
THINGS WE HAVE LEARNED, AND 
WHAT WE STILL NEED TO KNOW. 
THE FIRST THING IS, DO ALL 
MEDICAL PARKINSON'S DISEASE 
EXISTS WITH DEMENTIA, AND THEY 
HAVE  PATHOLOGY 
(INDISCERNIBLE), NOT ABOUT WAYS 
WE CAN DETECT A-SYNUCLEIN, AND 
YOU CAN SEE IT DOES. THE ASSAY 
IS NOT 100% SENSITIVE, BECAUSE 
THE ASSAY IS NOT SENSITIVE 
ENOUGH OR NOT ALL PATIENTS HAVE 
A-SYNUCLEIN?
A-SYNUCLEIN CONFIRMATIONS ARE 
THE SAME OR DIFFERENT ACROSS 
INDIVIDUALS?
ACROSS CLINICALLY IMPORTANT 
SUBTYPES?
I SHOW YOU SOME WORK THAT THERE 
MAY BE OTHER NORMAL FUNCTIONS 
OF ASYN. AND WE WONDER WHAT 
DOCTORS GATHERED ABOUT THE 
DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS OF ASYN IN 
PHYSIOLOGICAL DISEASE 
CONDITIONS. 
AND THERE IS A LOT OF OTHER 
PATHOLOGY. HOW DOES ASYN 
INTERACT WITH OTHER 
PATHOLOGICAL PROTEINS IN 
DISEASE PATHOGENESIS?
WHAT NON-ASYN- RELATED 
MECHANISM LEAD TO OR EXACERBATE 
DISEASE PATHOGENESIS?
RECOMMENDATION 7, WHICH ARE 
RATHER THE BEGINNING IS TO 
DEVELOP MODELS TO UNDERSTAND 
PATHOGENESIS MECHANISMS OF 
TOXICITY IN NORMAL MOLECULAR 
AND CELLULAR FUNCTIONS OF 
A-SYNUCLEIN. 
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT WE HAVE 
DETAILS AND THEY WILL BE MORE 
DETAILS IN OUR REPORT AND HOW 
WE THINK THIS CAN KIND OF BE 
WELL PURSUED. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
RECOMMENDATION 8, IS TO 
IDENTIFY MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY 
MECHANISMS OF SELECTED 
VULNERABILITY, DISEASE 
HETEROGENEITY, DISEASE 
SPREADING COMPETITION AND 
DIRECTION WITH OTHER 
AGE-RELATED PATHOLOGIES AS 
CLEAR TARGETS. AND THIS IS TO 
LOOK AT MIXED PATHOLOGY AND 
WHAT THE IMPACT IS AND TO 
UNDERSTAND OTHER FACTORS THAT 
LEAD TO NEURODEGENERATION. 
WITH THE IDEA THAT THESE MAY BE 
DISTINCT FROM THE MECHANISM. IS 
WHAT MAKES NEURODEGENERATION 
LOSS OF NEURONS, BE DIFFERENT 
FROM THE (INDISCERNIBLE) 
PATHOLOGY. 
BECAUSE WE THINK THE OTHER 
PROTEINS IN THE MIX WE WANT TO 
DEVELOP LBD MODELS THAT ARE 
NONEXCLUSIVE LEAD BASED ON 
A-SYNUCLEIN. 
AND WANT TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT 
OF DEMOGRAPHICS, AGE AND SEX 
FOR EXAMPLE ON LBD 
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND TOXIC 
MECHANISMS UNDERLYING DISEASE.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU EVERYONE SO
MUCH. 
THAT WAS A REALLY WONDERFUL 
PRESENTATION FROM ALL OF OUR 
SESSION GROUP AND NOW WE OPEN 
IT UP TO QUESTIONS FROM THE 
PUBLIC. 
AND I WILL MODERATE AND ASSIGN 
QUESTIONS TO THE PANELISTS. IF 
YOU DON'T MIND TURNING THE 
CAMERA YOURSELF. 
&gt;&gt; EVERYONE ON THE PANEL
IS 
WELCOME TO TURN ON THEIR 
CAMERAS SO YOU CAN POP UP ON 
THE SCREEN. 
THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; I SEE HELEN. YOUR HAND
IS 
RAISED. PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF 
WITH YOUR QUESTION. 
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU HEAR ME? 
&gt;&gt; YES WE CAN THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU DR. POSSTON. 
THANK YOU FOR THIS INCREDIBLE 
ANALYSIS OF ACROSS THE BROAD 
SPECTRUM OF SCIENCE. IS VERY, 
VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AS MANY 
OTHER PEOPLE ON BOARD HERE 
TODAY, I HAVE OVER 35 YEARS IN 
THE TRENCHES WITH THIS DISEASE 
DUE TO MULTIPLE GENERATIONS IN 
MY FAMILY. 
IS A LOOK FORWARD TO THE FUTURE 
OF MY FAMILY IN THE NEXT 
GENERATIONS I AM VERY, VERY 
CONCERNED ABOUT SATURDAY THE 
LACK OF FUNDING.  AND SO 
HOPEFULLY THAT CAN BE PUSHED 
FORWARD. 
BECAUSE AT THIS POINT, I HAVE 
BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN 
RESEARCH NOW AS A PARTICIPANT 
FOR OVER 18 YEARS.  AND OF 
COURSE THAT STARTED WITH JUST 
BEING PART OF PARKINSON'S 
STUDY. THERE WAS NO DLB STUDIES 
GOING ON. 
BUT AGAIN IT IS ME GOING OUT TO 
FIND WHAT IS GOING TO BE 
RELEVANT-- AND THE MOST RECENT 
I AM NOW PART OF NAPPS. 
BUT THAT CONCERNS ME THAT THERE 
ISN'T AN INTERCONNECTEDNESS 
CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL 
INSTITUTES. IS THERE ANY WAY 
THAT WE CAN HARMONIZE AND 
DE-SILO SOME OF THESE-- SO THE 
COHORTS CAN EXPAND SHARING OF 
INDIVIDUAL BASIC INFORMATION 
INCLUDING IT IN THE CONSENT 
WHEN THEY ARE SIGNING THE 
CONSENT FORM YOU HAVE 
PERMISSION TO SHARE WITH OTHER 
INSTITUTIONS, PURSUING SIMILAR 
SAMPLING.  ALL RELATIVE STUDIES.
 SO WE CAN GET THIS EXPANDED 
MORE RAPIDLY. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THAT 
OUTSTANDING QUESTION. 
I'M GOING TO MAKE A COMMENT, 
AND THEN PASS IT OVER TO DR. 
MORMINO WHO HAS DONE SOME HAVE 
THIS TYPE OF WORK WITHIN THE 
IMAGING SPACE WHICH MAY BE 
RELEVANT BROADLY. 
BUT I AGREE THAT ALL SAMPLES, 
THE SHARING OF THE SAMPLES AND 
SHARING OF DATA BROADLY IS 
REALLY AT THE HEART OF MULTIPLE 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
AND I ALSO THINK-- I REALLY 
APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT THERE 
ABOUT IT BEING ADDRESSED AT THE 
LEVEL OF THE CONSENT FORM.  I 
HAVE ALSO FOUND THAT IF IT IS 
NOT ON THE CONSENT FORM, THERE 
IS VERY LITTLE WE CAN DO DOWN 
THE ROAD. AND BEING VERY 
PROACTIVE ABOUT THIS, MOVING 
FORWARD. 
AND THAT IS ACTUALLY-- I DON'T 
THINK WE DIRECT THE ADDRESSED 
THAT IN OUR RECOMMENDATION SO 
THAT IS A GREAT WANT FOR US TO 
UPDATE AS WE MOVE FORWARD. 
ANY COMMENT FROM THE IMAGING 
PERSPECTIVE WITH THIS REGARD, 
OTHER WORK YOU HAVE DONE HERE?
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A PROBLEM
ACROSS ALL 
STUDIES THAT WE DO. NOT 
SPECIFIC TO LEVY BODY DEMENTIA. 
 IS CERTAINLY HARDER GOING 
BACKWARDS, COMBINING DATA 
BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE YOU'RE 
BRINGING UP. BECAUSE OF THE 
CONSENT.  BUT THERE ARE SOME 
CLEAR EXAMPLES OF SUCCESS IN 
THE SPACE. LIKE THE AT ME 
(PHONETIC) STUDY, SHARING DATA 
BROADLY IN THE CONTEXT OF 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. AND STUDY 
DESIGNS, PUTTING THIS LAND 
WITHIN THE CONTENT IS CRITICAL 
FOR BROAD DATA SHARING. 
AND FROM THE IMAGING SIDE THERE 
ARE CONCERNED NOT JUST WITH 
IMAGING, BUT ALL THE DATA WE 
COLLECT.  THERE ARE ISSUES WITH 
THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE DATA. 
AND THAT IS A CONCERN BALANCING 
THE TWO SIDES ARE PROTECTING 
RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS IN TERMS 
OF IDENTIFICATION. BUT WE ARE 
HEARING MORE AND MORE FROM 
PARTICIPANTS HOW IMPORTANT IT 
IS THAT THE DATA IS SHARED.
AND IN THE CONSENT, WE MAKE 
THESE RISKS STATED IN THE 
PARTICIPANTS NEED TO BE AWARE 
OF THESE RISKS AND MAKE A 
CHOICE OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY 
WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS 
STUDY, AND THIS BROAD DATA 
SHARING. 
ONE SPECIFIC ISSUE WITH THE 
IMAGING DATA FOR INSTANCES YOU 
CAN IDENTIFY THE FACE FROM SOME 
OF THE IMAGES THAT ARE 
COLLECTED. AND THAT REQUIRES 
ADDITIONAL PROTECTION MEASURES 
TO BE PLACED ON THAT IMAGING 
MODALITY IN PARTICULAR. 
I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU I 
WE SHOULD HAVE THIS IN OUR 
CONSENTS.  AND PARTICIPANT 
SHOULD BE AWARE AND THEY SHOULD 
BE A MOVE TOWARDS BROAD DATA 
SHARING ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT 
STUDIES WHEN AT ALL POSSIBLE.
 &gt;&gt; DR. CHEN?
&gt;&gt; DR. CHEN-PLOTKIN: THE
ONE I 
KNOW THE MOST ABOUT IS THE 
PARKINSON'S IS BIOMARKER 
PROGRAM MORE PDP EXISTENCES 
2012.  YOU MAY HAVE ENROLLED IN 
THE STUDY THROUHG A SITE, FOR 
THE CONSENT IS BROUGHT IN THE 
REASON I KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE 
I'M A USER OF MANY OF THE 
SAMPLES AND SO I DO THINK THAT 
THERE IS AWARENESS AT THE LEVEL 
OF BIO SAMPLES ORGANIZED IN THE 
(INDISCERNIBLE) LEVEL, HAVING 
CONSENT FOR BROAD SHARING AND 
ESSENTIALLY HAVING A COMMITTEE 
OF PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT REQUESTS 
TO SEE THE REQUESTS A 
REASONABLE AND THEN SHARE OUT 
THE SAMPLES. 
THAT IS DEFINITELY HAPPENING.  
MY LAB FOR EXAMPLE HAS 
BENEFITED GREATLY FROM THAT.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; VIKI, YOUR HAND IS UP
IF YOU 
DON'T MIND AND MUTING HERSELF 
AND ASKING A QUESTION OR 
COMMENT.
&gt;&gt; HI. MY MOTHER HAS BEEN 
DIAGNOSED -- WELL, ACTUALLY SHE 
REALLY HASN'T BEEN DIAGNOSED 
WITH ANYTHING. THAT IS MY 
QUESTION. 
AT FIRST, SHE DID GET A 
DIAGNOSIS OF ... MILD COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT.  AND NOW IT SAYS ON 
HER CHART, "MAJOR 
NEUROMUSCULAR, OR 
NEURODEGENERATIVE" SOMETHING. 
ANYWAY I WAS WONDERING WHAT 
KIND OF TESTS SHOULD I INSIST 
UPON OR DO I EVEN HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO TRY TO FIND OUT A MORE 
DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS? I GUESS.
&gt;&gt; DR. -- WHICH LIKE TO
ADDRESS 
THIS ISSUE? OR DR. TOLEDO, TO 
TALK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE AT THIS 
POINT TO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES 
IS THE BALANCE OF THE 
BIOMARKERS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE 
OF THE RESEARCH USE VERSUS 
WHERE WE ARE IN CLINICAL 
IMPLEMENTATION AND THERE IS A 
DISTINCTION THERE. IF YOU TWO 
WOULD NOT MIND COMMENTING ON 
THAT. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR YOUR
QUESTION. 
 IT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE, AND 
ONE THAT WE HEAR FROM OFTEN.  
IS A CHANCE TO IDENTIFY A 
CLINICIAN WHO HAS KNOWLEDGE IN 
THIS AREA. AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO 
NOT BE FORTUNATE TO MEET WITH A 
KNOWLEDGEABLE CLINICIAN 
INITIALLY, SEEK INPUT TO MEET 
WITH SOMEONE ELSE AND THERE ARE 
AMPLE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 
AVAILABLE. 
AND THE CLINICIAN FOR WHATEVER 
REASON DOESN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW 
ABOUT THEM HONESTLY THEY WON'T 
BE USED. I SHOULD POINT OUT 
THAT THAT THE -- CENTER FOR 
EXCELLENCE PROGRAM THERE ARE 
OVER TWO DOZEN SPREAD ACROSS 
COUNTRY AND THAT NETWORK BUT 
DESIGNED FOR CLINICIANS WHO DO 
THIS FOR A LIVING. 
AND SO IF YOU HAPPEN TO LIVE 
FAR FROM ONE OF THE CENTERS, 
THAT DOES CREATE SOME 
CHALLENGES. BUT HOPEFULLY THAT 
IS AT LEAST PARTIALLY HELPFUL. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY THANK YOU. I
APPRECIATE 
THAT.
&gt;&gt; ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS
FOR 
PANELISTS?
I SEE ... MIKE LEE.  WOULD YOU 
MIND UNMUTING YOURSELF? YOU 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; I CAN HEAR YOUR GO
AHEAD. 
&gt;&gt; REALLY WONDERFUL 
PRESENTATIONS. I REALLY 
APPRECIATE IT. I LOVE THE 
ACTION ITEMS. 
ONE THING THAT I DID WANT TO 
MENTION IS THAT AS YOU ALL KNOW 
LEVY BODY DEMENTIA UNLIKE 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IS 
ASSOCIATED WITH VERY LITTLE 
NEURODEGENERATION AT LEAST IN 
THE LIMBIC AREA. 
AND I WE NEED TO MAYBE PUT MORE 
EMPHASIS ON WHAT NUCLEON 
PATHOLOGY DOES AT THE CELLULAR 
LEVEL AND CIRCUIT LEVEL. THERE 
IS THE OPPORTUNITY THERE TO 
UNDERSTAND THE PATHOBIOLOGY AS 
A CERTAIN LEVEL WHAT YOU HAVE 
DEMENTIA IN LEVY BODY DEMENTIA. 
WE ARE IN ALZHEIMER'S, 
OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE LOSING 
NEURONS. THAT IS NOT SURPRISING 
THAT I WAS SURPRISED THAT THERE 
WAS NOT AS MUCH OF THAT FOCUS.  
AND I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO 
HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF 
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE 
NEURONS. 
&gt;&gt; GREAT QUESTION. DR. 
CHEN-PLOTKIN?
&gt;&gt; DR. CHEN-PLOTKIN: YOU
IF YOU 
KNOW THE TWOS REGULATIONS I 
HAVE, ONE FOCUSED ON 
A-SYNUCLEIN.  THAT WAS ACTUALLY 
A BOLD MOVE FROM A COMMITTEE TO 
KIND OF PUT A LOT OF EMPHASIS 
ON A-SYNUCLEIN, AND 
UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONS 
A-SYNUCLEIN HAS IN NEURONS. AND 
SPREAD THE CONFIRMATIONS.
THE REASON THERE IS EMPHASIS ON 
THAT IN THE COMMITTEE IS THAT 
SO MUCH HAS BEEN LEARNED ABOUT 
A-SYNUCLEIN.  AND AS I SAID IT 
IS NOW IN CLINICAL TESTING. SO 
WE REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND 
THIS. OKAY?
AT THE SAME TIME, THE 8TH 
RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT BASICALLY 
THE DIRECTION OF OTHER THINGS 
WITH A-SYNUCLEIN. 
WE COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU. 
WHY IS IT THAT IN SOME PEOPLE 
SOME CIRCUITS ARE MORE 
VULNERABLE? RIGHT?
IS IT RELATED TO THE 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATHOLOGY 
THAT OCCURS IN SOME PEOPLE 
VERSUS NOT, WHICH ONE STUDY 
SUGGESTS IS THE CASE. 
IS THAT RELATED TO OTHER 
FACTORS?
GENETIC, GENOMIC, BIOMARKER 
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS?
THAT IS CAPTURED IN 8.  WHAT 
YOU ARE RIGHT WE NEED TO 
UNDERSTAND THIS BETTER. 
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON
THAT 
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND YOUR 
PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF HOW IT 
IS GREAT IN THE CIRCUIT FASHION.
THAT IS A PATHOLOGY. 
I'M TALKING MORE ABOUT ACTUALLY 
AT A FUNCTIONAL LEVEL. WE HAVE 
A VERY, VERY LIMITED 
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE 
NUCLEON PATHOLOGY, WHY IS IT 
NOT DEAD?
CORTICAL NEURONS, THEY DON'T 
DIE WHEN YOU HAVE NUCLEON 
PATHOLOGY, BUT WE HAVE VERY 
LITTLE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW 
THAT AFFECTS THE NEURAL 
FUNCTION AND HOW THAT NEURON IN 
THAT CONTEXT AFFECTS THE 
CIRCUIT, WHICH IS VERY, VERY 
SIGNIFICANT THING IN TERMS OF 
HOW HUMANS ACTUALLY BEHAVE. 
THAT IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO 
HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING. 
&gt;&gt; DR. CHEN-PLOTKIN: WE
AGREE 
WITH YOU AND I APOLOGIZE IF I 
WAS NOT CLEAR ENOUGH. THAT WAS 
A DECISION WAS TRYING TO MAKE 
BETWEEN FACTORS OF NEURAL 
PATHOLOGY VERSUS 
NEURODEGENERATION. THEY ARE 
RELATED TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY 
ARE NOT THE SAME. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THE
COMMENT. 
WE HAVE A FEW HANDS HERE. I 
APOLOGIZE. NUMBER ONE, ... IF 
YOU WOULDN'T MIND UNMUTING. 
&gt;&gt; (CLARIFY THE
PRONUNCIATION)
(INDISCERNIBLE). 
I WANTED TO ASK THE QUESTION 
CONCERNING LEVY BODY DEMENTIA 
IN 21 CHROMOSOME TRISOMICS 
(PHONETIC). 
QUICK QUESTION. 
&gt;&gt; IF YOU COULD REPEAT
THAT. I 
DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND. 
&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS ABOUT
LEVY 
BODY DEMENTIA, IT HAS 
A-SYNUCLEIN NEUROPATHY IN 21 
CHROMOSOME TRISOMICS IN DOWN 
SYNDROME. 
THAT WAS NOT COVERED. 
&gt;&gt; NO. THAT WAS NOT. 
MY GENERAL UNDERSTANDING, NOT 
BEING THE GENETICIST ON THIS 
PANEL, IS THAT WHILE 
ALZHEIMER'S-ASSOCIATED 
PATHOLOGY AND DEMENTIA IS 
HEAVILY ASSOCIATED WITH TRISOMY 
21 DOWN SYNDROME AND LEVY BODY 
DEMENTIA PATHOLOGY IS LESS 
LIKELY ASSOCIATED. DOCTOR-- IF 
YOU COULD CLARIFY THIS PERMIT 
PATHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE, THAT 
WE DO NOT SEE LEVY BODY 
PATHOLOGY?
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NOT SEEN MANY
DOWN 
SYNDROME BRAINS. I WISH I COULD 
KNOW THE LITERATURE. FEEL FREE 
TO EMAIL ME AND I CAN GET BACK 
TO YOU, TO MAKE SURE IT IS 
ANSWERED. THIS IS BEING 
RECORDED. SO WE WILL HAVE THIS 
RECORDED. 
&gt;&gt; DR. TOLEDO?
&gt;&gt; DR. TOLEDO ATUCHA:
ACTUALLY 
IT IS PRETTY PREVALENT. THE 
LEVY BODY IS ACTING IN 
(INDISCERNIBLE) PATHOLOGY AND 
WE NEED SOME CORE SYMPTOMS 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRISOMIC 
PATHOLOGY -- THINK THAT IS VERY 
COMPLEX BECAUSE AS YOU SAW IN 
THE PREVIOUS TALK, THE NORM IS 
HAVING MULTIPLE CO-PATHOLOGIES. 
 BUT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THOSE 
PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA THEY HAVE 
PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
WITH (INDISCERNIBLE) PATHOLOGY. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS PART OF WHAT
THE 
PREVIOUS SESSION WAS TRYING TO 
ADDRESS.  HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT 
THESE MIXED ETIOLOGY SITUATIONS 
IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE WAY?
AND GENETICALLY DEFINED 
NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS 
REALLY DO FALL UNDER THAT. SOME 
OF THEM ARE ONE PATHOLOGY, 
OTHERS HAVE A MIXED PICTURE FOR 
THE CLINICAL PRESENTATION IS 
NOT TYPICAL FOR THE CLASSIC 
PHENOTYPE. 
I BELIEVE THAT IS ACTUALLY 
SOMETHING THAT VERY MUCH NEEDS 
TO BE ADDRESSED.  THANK YOU FOR 
BRINGING THAT UP. 
&gt;&gt; WE ARE AT THE END OF
TIME. 
WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BRING 
THEIR REMAINING QUESTIONS TO 
THE FURTHER PUBLIC INPUT 
SESSION SCHEDULED TO START AT 
2:50 THIS AFTERNOON. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU TO ALL THE 
PRESENTERS. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU EVERYONE. 
&gt;&gt; WE WILL HAVE A SHORT
BREAK 
WHILE WE GET THE NEXT SESSION 
SET UP, AND THEN GO STRAIGHT 
INTO THE LAST SESSION OF TODAY. 
WE WILL BE BACK IN 3 MINUTES.
THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; IS THE SESSION READY TO
GET 
STARTED?
&gt;&gt; DR. FOSSATI: I AM CAN
YOU 
HEAR ME?
&gt;&gt; I CAN. 
&gt;&gt; DR. FOSSATI: IT WAS
REALLY 
AN HONOR AND A PLEASURE TO 
COCHAIR THE SESSION TOGETHER 
WITH HANZHANG LU. 
AND SO I WILL GIVE YOU A BRIEF 
INTRODUCTION ON VCID MECHANISMS 
AND THEN GO AHEAD AND GIVE YOU 
LIKE THE FIRST TWO 
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE ON THE 
BASIC MECHANISMS.
WHAT IS VCID?
THESE ARE MY VIEWS AND I DON'T 
HAVE ANY DISCLOSURES. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
WHAT IS VCID?
VASCULAR CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND 
DEMENTIA?
THE SCIENCE OF VCID IS 
SIGNIFICANT COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT, RESULTING IN BRAIN 
LESION, LIKE MICRO INFARCT, 
ARTERIOSCLEROSIS, SYSTEMIC 
ATTACKS AND SEVERAL OTHERS. 
VCID IS NOT ONLY A BRAIN ISSUE 
BUT IS IMPORTANT SYSTEMIC 
COMPONENTS, VERY COMMON WITH 
AGING. 
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT IT IS AT 
LEAST IN PART PREVENTABLE. 
SO, THE COGNITIVE OUTCOMES 
ASSOCIATED WITH VCID CAN VARY 
IN TERMS OF LIKE HOW SERIOUS 
THESE INJURIES ARE. BUT ALSO IN 
ANATOMICAL LOCATION OF THE 
INJURY, COMORBIDITIES IN 
VASCULAR RISK FACTORS AND 
SEVERAL OTHER FACTORS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
OF COURSE WE HAVE TO KEEP IN 
MIND THAT VCID DOESN'T EXIST IN 
ISOLATION, BUT IN MANY CASES IT 
HAPPENS TOGETHER WITH 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATHOLOGY 
SO AMYLOID -- PATHOLOGY. 
WE HAVE TO CONSIDER ALL OF 
THESE TOGETHER AND WE KNOW 
RIGHT NOW AS MANY OF THE 
COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE 
HIGHLIGHTED IT MAKES THE 
PATHOLOGY DEMENTIA THE MOST 
COMMON FORM, AND VASCULAR-- OF 
THE MOST FREQUENT COMBINATION. 
WE HAVE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE 
SCIENCE OF VCID IS VERY MUCH 
MULTIDISCIPLINARY. IT HAS TO 
ACCOUNT VASCULAR PATHOLOGY AND 
RISK FACTORS, AND A LOT OF 
THINGS THAT HAPPENED LIKE HYPER 
PERFUSION, BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER 
PROBLEMS, FLOW ISSUES, 
CLEARANCE ISSUES, ETC. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO IF WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT IN 
THOSE FAMOUS BIOMARKER CURVES 
THE VASCULAR BIOMARKERS IF WE 
ASSUME THAT THESE ARE 
IRRESPECTIVE OF HISTOLOGIC 
PROCESSES WE CAN SEE IN THE 
LIGHT BROWN CURVE IS THE 
VASCULAR BIOMARKERS. AND 
VASCULAR DISREGULATION MAY BE 
EARLY SIGNS OF BRAIN FACTOR, 
ASSOCIATED WITH ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE DEVELOPMENT. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
WE TALK ABOUT VCID, WE REALLY 
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE 
NEUROVASCULAR UNIT AND THE 
CEREBRAL VASCULAR SYSTEM WE CAN 
ACCOMPLISH UNIT OF CELLS THAT 
SURROUND AND INCLUDE THE 
CEREBRAL VESSELS. AND THESE 
CHANGES VARY DEPENDING ON THE 
SIZE OF THE VESSELS, 
MICROVASCULAR VESSELS, BIG 
VESSELS. BUT ALSO WHERE IN THE 
BRAIN WE ARE. THE BRAIN 
LOCALIZATION, HIPPOCAMPUS 
VERSUS CORTEX.
AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT 
THE CONTROL OF CEREBROVASCULAR 
FUNCTION DOES NOT ONLY DEPEND 
ON BRAIN FACTORS, SOCIAL 
NEUROVASCULAR COUPLING, BUT 
ALSO ON PERIPHERAL SYSTEMIC 
FACTORS SUCH AS BLOOD PRESSURE, 
PRESSURE OF CO2 AND OTHERS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND VCID OF COURSE AS MANY RISK 
FACTORS.  A LOT OF THEM ARE 
SHARED WITH CARDIOVASCULAR 
DISEASES. 
WE HAVE NONMODIFIABLE RISK 
FACTORS LIKE AGE, SEX, AND 
GENETICS. BEHAVIORAL AND 
LIFESTYLE RISK FACTORS, BUT 
ALSO PSYCHOSOCIAL, 
SOCIOECONOMIC AND OTHER RISK 
FACTORS. 
WANTED A REALLY IMPORTANT TO 
FOCUS ON OUR METABOLIC RISK 
FACTORS SUCH AS OBESITY, 
DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, AND 
MANY OTHERS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND SO, THESE RECEPTORS 
TOGETHER CAN PROMOTE  DEMENTIA 
PATHOLOGY. 
AND WE LOOK AT THE RISK FACTORS 
DEPENDING ON SEX, ACTUALLY THE 
RISK FACTORS MAY HAVE A 
DIFFERENT IMPACT IN MEN VERSUS 
WOMEN FOR EXAMPLE HEART DISEASE 
IS MORE OF A FACTOR IN MEN AND 
HYPERTENSION IS MORE OF A 
FACTOR FOR WOMEN. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO TO FINISH THIS INTRODUCTION, 
I REALLY WANT TO THANK ALL THE 
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.  THIS WAS AN 
INCREDIBLY COHESIVE AND 
COLLABORATIVE PROCESS.  AND 
ESPECIALLY I WANT TO THANK -- 
THAT HELP TOGETHER AND ORGANIZE 
THIS COMMITTEE. COULD NOT HAVE 
DONE THIS WITHOUT THEM. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO I'LL GO NOW INTO THE BASIC 
SCIENCE RECOMMENDATIONS. 
THE FIRST ONE PRIORITY ONE IS 
TO UNDERSTAND MECHANISMS OF 
VASCULAR DISEASE ONSET AND 
PROGRESSION, SPECIFIC CELL 
TYPES AND INTERACTIONS IN THE 
CONTEXT OF COGNITIVE DECLINE. 
AND SO FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC 
SYMPTOMS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS 
AND THIS SHOULD INCLUDE CELLS 
OF OF THE CEREBRAL POPULAR 
SYSTEM INCLUDING ENDOTHELIAL 
CELLS, ASTROCYTES, MICROGLIA 
AND OTHERS. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
(INDISCERNIBLE) FOR SPECIFIC 
CELL TYPES OF THE NEUROVASCULAR 
UNIT YOU SEE THERE IS A GROWING 
NUMBER OF CITATIONS WITH 60 
RESULTS IN 2024. BUT OF COURSE 
WE NEED TO DO MORE. 
THIS ALSO ALLOWED THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES 
THAT GAVE US THE POSSIBILITY TO 
DO SINGLE CELL RNA SEQUENCING 
OR SINGLE CELL ANALYSIS IN 
CELLS OF THE HUMAN BRAIN 
VASCULATURE ACROSS DISEASE AND 
IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND 
VASCULAR DYSFUNCTION IN 
PARTICULAR. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND ALSO THANKS TO THESE RNA 
SEQUENCING STUDIES WE HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO PINPOINT WHERE 
IMPORTANT PATHWAYS AND 
MECHANISMS. 
WE KNOW THAT THE STUDY SHOULD 
CLARIFY ALL THESE MECHANISMS 
INCLUDING LOSS OF BLOOD BRAIN 
BARRIER INTEGRITY, 
ANGIOGENESIS, AND HOW THE LAWS 
OF BLOOD BARRIER INTEGRITY 
AFFECTS BRAIN BIOMARKERS, AND 
WE HAVE TO DO MORE INTERESTED 
IN HOW THESE PATHWAYS CHANGE 
AND HOW THESE CELLS INTERACT IN 
DETERMINING THE CHANGES. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND, OF COURSE, AB PATHOLOGY IS 
INVOLVED IN THIS MECHANISMS AS 
WELL. 
WE KNOW THAT -- DEPOSITS IN THE 
VESSELS, CAA IN PARTICULAR BUT 
RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT 
TAU ACCUMULATING THE BRAIN 
VASCULATURE. WE ARE STARTING TO 
UNDERSTAND THE TAU EFFECTS OF 
THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER THAT 
AFFECTS ENDOTHELIAL CELLS 
REDUCING PYRAMID ABILITY. THIS 
SHOULD ALSO BE STUDIED. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
WE WANT TO IMPROVE THE 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF 
THE CID ON THE INTERACTION 
BETWEEN DIFFERENT CELL TYPES AS 
WELL AS ON THE MOVEMENT AND 
CLEARANCE OF MOLECULES ACROSS 
THE PERIVASCULAR SPACE, CSF AND 
BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER. AND MANY 
MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN POINTED 
OUT SUCH AS INTRAMURAL 
DRAINAGE, LYMPHATIC DRAINAGE,  
MENINGEAL LYMPHATIC CLEARANCE 
AND PERIVASCULAR LEARN 
MICROPHAGES. THIS MOVEMENT 
AFFECT THE MOVEMENT AND 
CLEARANCE OF MOLECULES AND HOW 
THEY INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER 
IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND WE SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER 
VASCULAR PATHOLOGY SUCH AS 
CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAPHY, CEREBRAL 
ARTERIAL SCLEROSIS, AND HOW WE 
CAN PREVENT DISEASES FOR 
EXAMPLE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, 
DEMENTIA IN A DIFFERENT WAY WE 
SHOULD CONSIDER ALL OF THEM 
TOGETHER OR IN COMBINATION. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO, IN ADDITION TO COGNITIVE 
DECLINE WE SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER 
OUTCOMES THAT ARE RELATED TO 
COGNITIVE DECLINE, BUT MORE 
VASCULAR SPECIFICS SUCH AS 
MARKER HEMORRHAGES, WHITE 
MATTER (INDISCERNIBLE) IN LARGE 
PERIVASCULAR SPACES AND LYPO 
PERFUSION. AND THERE ARE SOME 
NICE ANIMAL MODELS, FOR EXAMPLE 
MARKER HEMORRHAGES ON THE LEFT 
SIDE, AND YOU CAN SEE A RAT 
MODEL WHICH ALLOWS US TO SEE 
WHITE MATTER ISSUES BETTER THAN 
MOUSE MODELS. 
AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE, YOU CAN 
SEE HOW THE NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES 
ALLOW US TO MONITOR CEREBRAL 
BLOOD FLOW FOR EXAMPLE IN MICE 
THAT ARE ALIVE AND AWAKE AND WE 
CAN SEE CAPILLARY STALL IN THE 
RECENT PAPER WE PUBLISHED. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO THE NEXT RECOMMENDATION, THE 
SECOND RECOMMENDATION PRIORITY 
2, IS TO DISCOVER VCID 
MECHANISMS AND POTENTIAL 
TARGETS BY LEVERAGING DATA AND 
BY ESTABLISHING, REFINING AND 
UTILIZING HUMAN, ANIMAL, AND 
CELL-BASED EXPERIMENTERS MODELS 
AND TECHNOLOGIES. 
NEXT SLIDE. THESE MODELS SHOULD 
INCLUDE ALSO SYSTEMIC AND 
CHRONIC PERIVASCULAR DISEASES, 
FOR EXAMPLE HYPERTENSION AND 
HEART CARDIAC FAILURE, AND TRY 
TO MODEL THEM. 
HERE UNLESS YOU SEE A RAT MODEL 
THAT INCLUDES A SET OF THE 
SMALL VESSEL DISEASE IN THE 
PRESENCE OF MANY OF THESE 
CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS 
SUCH AS HYPERTENSION, AGING, 
AND CEREBRAL LIPO PERFUSION AND 
WHEN YOU PUT THEM ALTOGETHER 
YOU HAVE AN INCREDIBLE LOSS OF 
CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW. 
AND WE MODEL TWO OF THESE 
VASCULAR PATHOLOGY SUCH AS CAA, 
AND HYPER HOMO STEMIA 
(PHONETIC), THERE IS AN 
EFFECTIVE LOSS OF FUNCTION 
PROCESS AND THE CORRESPONDING 
ANIMAL MODEL THAT GIVES US THE 
SAME RESULTS ON BLOOD-BRAIN 
BARRIER PERMEABILITY. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND THE STUDY SHOULD CLARIFY 
THE MECHANISMS AND MOLECULAR 
TARGETS OF VASCULAR DISEASE AND 
OTHER KEEP PATHOGENIC PROCESSES 
RESULTING IN COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT. FOR EXAMPLE MICRO 
HEMORRHAGES IN MANY OF THE 
OTHER ONES WE TALK ABOUT.
THERE MANY ANIMAL MODELS 
ALREADY DEVELOPED FOR EXAMPLE 
FOR CAA, IN MANY OF THESE 
PATHOLOGIES SUCH AS THIS ONE, , 
AND SEVERAL OTHER ANIMAL MODELS 
BUT SOME PRIVATE MODELS ARE 
COMING UP...
&gt;&gt; TWO MINUTES. 
&gt;&gt; DR. FOSSATI: FOR
EXAMPLE, 
THE SQUIRREL MONKEYS THAT 
DEVELOP CAA THAT DEVELOPS 
SPONTANEOUSLY WITH AGE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
WE SHOULD GIVE ATTENTION TO 
LIFESTYLE VASCULAR AND 
METABOLIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED 
WITH NORMAL AGING AND CHRONIC 
CONDITION, IN ADDITION TO 
(INDISCERNIBLE) PATHOLOGY. 
AND SO THE RISK FACTORS INCLUDE 
OF COURSE VASCULAR RISK 
FACTORS, TRAUMATIC BRAIN 
INJURY, MENOPAUSE FOR WOMEN, 
AND WE CAN HAVE THINGS SUCH AS 
(INDISCERNIBLE) SIZE THAT CAN 
HELP PREVENT VASCULAR RISK 
FACTORS. 
HERE IS A NICE IMAGE TO SHOW 
FOR EXAMPLE IMMUNE REGULATION 
IS CHANGING AT DIFFERENT TIMES 
DURING AND AFTER TRAUMATIC RAIN 
INJURY. (CORRECTION) TRAUMATIC 
BRAIN INJURY. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
WHICH ALSO CONSIDER USING 3D 
AND PSC MODELS TO INCORPORATE 
FLOW TO HAVE A MORE 
PERSONALIZED MEDICINE CREATE 
DIFFERENT CELL TYPES AND 3D 
CHIP MODELS WILL INCORPORATE 
THE FLOW. 
AND WE CAN TAKE SOME OF THESE 
FROM THE CARDIOVASCULAR FIELD.  
OF COURSE WE HAVE TO INCLUDE 
ALL THE OTHER CELLS OF THE 
NEUROVASCULAR UNIT. THERE ARE 
3D ORGANOIDS THAT ARE BEING 
DEVELOPED EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE 
NOT YET FUNCTIONAL AND 3D CHIPS 
THAT CAN HELP US RECAPITULATE 
THE NEUROVASCULAR UNIT REALLY 
HELPFUL AS WELL. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
WE SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE 
SEX-LINK BIOLOGY AND MENOPAUSE 
IN THE INTERACTIONS. WOMEN ARE 
AT HIGHER RISK OF VCID, AND THE 
MENOPAUSE TRANSITION IS 
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS 
RISK. WE SHOULD LOOK AT THE 
RELATIVE CONSIDERATION OF 
THEIRS MECHANISMS AND MANY OF 
THESE CLEARANCE MECHANISMS HAVE 
BEEN CLARIFIED IN THE LAST FEW 
YEARS.  BUT WE REALLY NEED TO 
UNDERSTAND BETTER THEIR 
INTERACTIONS. 
THANK YOU. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
I WILL KNOW LEAVE THE 
MICROPHONE TO GARETH HOWELL 
PULLED RECOMMENDATIONS. 
&gt;&gt; WAS A PLEASURE TO BE
PART OF 
THIS PANEL. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
I HAVE, THESE ARE MY 
DISCLAIMERS AND DISCLOSURES I 
AM GARETH HOWELL, PROFESSOR AT 
THE -- CHAIR AND LABORATORY. 
I'M GOING TO COVER 
RECOMMENDATIONS 3 AND 4. 
RECOMMENDATION 3, PRIORITY OF 
4, 
CROSS VALIDATE THE MECHANISMS 
OF ANIMAL MODELS AND HUMAN 
STUDIES TO ENSURE PHASE AND 
CONSTRUCT VALIDITY INCLUDING 
MIX PATHOLOGIES, NORMAL 
VASCULAR AGING AND COMMUNITY 
BASED COHORT. 
UNDERLINING THIS ONE OF THE 
FIRST BULLET OF THIS IS TO WORK 
TRANSLATIONALLY TO CHARACTERIZE 
THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS OF 
VASCULAR RISK FACTORS AND AD 
MECHANISMS DISCOVERED IN CELL 
AND ANIMAL MODELS TO BIOMARKERS 
OF CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE. 
BOTH RECOMMENDATIONS HOW DID 
THE NEED TO IMPROVE THE 
TRANSLATION BETWEEN MODELS AND 
THE CLINICAL DISEASE. 
AND SO IN A WAY WE THINK ABOUT 
EXAMPLES OF VCID AS WAS 
DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY, WITH 
THINK ABOUT CEREBRAL AMYLOID, 
AND CEREBRAL MICROBLEEDS. 
THERE IS A NEED HERE TO REALLY 
POTENTIALLY REDEFINE THE 
BIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF VCID 
OBSERVED IN THE CLINIC. 
SIMPLY OBSERVING THE PATHOLOGY 
FOR INSTANCE IN THE MASS MODEL 
DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN IT IS 
DRIVEN BY THE SAME FACTORS THAT 
WOULD BE SEEN IN THE CLINIC. 
WE NEED TO WORK HARDER TO 
UNDERSTAND THESE BOTH IN THE 
HUMAN CONDITIONS, BUT ALSO IN 
OUR MODELS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF 
THIS RECOMMENDATION IS TO 
EVALUATE THE MECHANISMS LEADING 
TO AMYLOID RELATED IMAGING 
ABNORMALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH 
THESE AMYLOID IMMUNOTHERAPIES 
AND USING THE HUMAN AND 
EXPERIMENTAL MODELS, IMPORTANT 
TO RECOGNIZE THAT MODELS HAVE A 
HARD TIME IN THIS PATIENT WAS 
SHOWN MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO 
THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO CLEAR 
AMYLOID FROM RAINS AND EVEN 
LEAD TO ARIA-LIKE PATHOLOGIES. 
IT WAS NOT CALLED ARIA BACK 
THEN. 
IT CAN BE MORE PREDICTABLE AS 
WE THINK ABOUT IMPROVING 
THERAPIES FOR THINGS LIKE 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND RELATED 
DIMENSIONS IN THE VCID SPACE. 
AND THE SQUIRREL MONKEYS SYLVIA 
POINTED TO, WE NEED TO THINK 
ABOUT EXPANDING NOT JUST IN THE 
CELL SPACE BUT ALSO IN THE 
ANIMAL MODEL SPACE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND I WHEN WE THINK ABOUT 
IMPROVING OUR MODEL COLLECTION, 
AND AS WE BUILD TO CROSS 
VALIDATE ASSETS, WE NEED TO 
THINK ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT 
FACTORS THAT ARE OBSERVED IN 
THE CLINIC INCLUDING SEX AND 
AGE AS BIOLOGICAL BARRIERS, 
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES SHOULD 
INCLUDE ANIMAL MODELS AND THE 
EXTENT OF DIVERSITY IN THIS IS 
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE 
THINK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
RISK FACTORS AS WAS DESCRIBED 
BEFORE, AS WELL AS THE GENETICS 
PRESENT IN HUMAN POPULATIONS. 
AND THERE'S A REAL FEELING THAT 
SOMETIMES WE DO THE QUICK AND 
EASY EXPERIMENT IN THE MASS 
MODELS, OR EVEN ANY  ANIMAL 
MODEL DESPITE THE FACT THAT 
THERE IS A WEALTH OF RESOURCES 
THAT CAN BE ACCESSED THAT HAVE 
BEEN SHOWN TO BE REALLY 
IMPORTANT IN IMPROVING THE 
TRANSLATION BETWEEN HUMANS AND 
MICE. 
I AM SHOWING HERE ON THE 
LEFT-HAND SIDE THAT WE COMMONLY 
USE C57 BLACK 6. BUT THERE'S A 
WHOLE ARRAY OF OTHER THINGS 
LISTED HERE ESSENTIALLY 
INCORPORATING AS MUCH GENETIC 
VARIATION AS YOU CAN SEE  IN 
THE HUMAN POPULATION AND YOU 
CAN GET QUITE DIFFERENT RESULTS 
IF YOU TRY AND DRIVE A HUMAN 
RELEVANT PATHOLOGY DEPENDING ON 
THE STRAIN. 
ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE I AM 
SHOWING A PHOTOGRAPH OF 
CEREBRAL AMYLOID -- TAKING BY 
OLIVIA-- IN MY LAB AND 
HIGHLIGHTS THAT THE B STRAIN 
CARRIES THE GENETIC THAT MAKES 
MICE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CAA.  
SO I WE NEED TO DO BETTER IN 
INCORPORATING AND LEVERAGING 
ALL OF THE MASS GENETIC 
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE 
AVAILABLE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO WE RECOMMEND 4, PRIORITY 3. 
DEVELOP AND ADVANCE ESSENTIAL 
NEW THERAPEUTICS AND SELL AN 
ANIMAL MODEL TO PREVENT OR 
TREAT VCID. TO TARGET 
PREVENTION OR TREATMENT OF 
VCID-RELATED COGNITIVE DECLINE 
WORKING TOWARDS OPTIMIZING 
TRANSLATION FROM CELL AND 
ANIMAL MODELS TO CLINICAL 
TRIALS. 
THIS DIAGRAM HAS BEEN SHOWN 
BEFORE, ABOUT WHERE WE ARE WITH 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.  AND I 
REALLY DON'T NEED TO SEE ALL 
THE DETAILS OF THIS.  YOU CAN 
SEE THAT THERE IS A LARGE 
NUMBER OF CLINICAL TRIALS THAT 
ARE AT DIFFERENT PHASES FOR 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. AND THE 
MECHANISMS OF ACTION ARE VARIED 
SO A LOT OF AMYLOID BUT ALSO 
EMERGING IN OTHER AREAS SUCH AS 
NEURAL INFLAMMATION, EPIGENETIC 
REGULATIONS, MITOCHONDRIAL 
HEALTH, ETC.
BOTH OF THESE CATEGORIES YOU 
NOTICE THERE AREN'T REALLY ANY 
SPECIFICALLY TARGETING OR 
IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF 
CEREBRAL VASCULAR AND LYMPHATIC 
CELLS, WHICH WE SHOULD BE 
TARGETING POTENTIALLY 
UNDERLYING MECHANISMS SO WE 
REALLY WANT TO SEE THIS CHANGE 
MOVING FORWARD. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THIS WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER 
ABOUT MODEL AD. 
IN THE ALZHEIMER'S SPACE WE 
ALREADY DEVELOPED NEW WAYS OF 
DEVELOPING MASS MODELS THAT ARE 
MUCH MORE HUMAN RELEVANT, 
ENSURING THAT WE START WITH 
CLINICAL DATA, AND BUILDING 
MODELS BASED ON CLINICAL DATA, 
PARTICULARLY THE GENETIC 
INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE. 
GENETIC IN COMBINATION WITH 
ENVIRONMENTAL MONEY RELATION 
SUCH AS HIGH-FAT DIET AND TOXIC 
METALS, THAT IMPROVE THE 
VALIDITY OF THOSE MASS MODELS 
AND THE TRANSLATABLE METHOD 
SUCH AS FLUID -- AND WE DO THE 
CLINICAL SCREENINGS SUCH AS 
DRUG TESTING YOU KNOW THESE 
MODELS HAVE BEEN ALIGNED TO THE 
CLINICAL DISEASE THAT YOU ARE 
ACTUALLY STARTING. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND THEN FINALLY UNLESS 
RECOMMENDATION THERAPEUTICS 
PREVENTION OF PRECISION MEDS 
APPROACHES SHOULD ADDRESS ARIA 
COMPONENT WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT 
COMPONENT AS IT INVOLVES 
VCID-RELATED ABNORMALITIES. 
THE KEY POINT I WANT TO MAKE 
YOUR THAT AS WE THINK ABOUT 
DEVELOPING THERAPIES THERE MAY 
NOT BE A SINGLE TREATMENT BUT 
MORE MORE THESE ARE GOING TO BE 
COMBINATORIAL THERAPIES, EVEN 
IN COMBINATION WITH HEALTHIER 
LIVING RECOMMENDATIONS. IS 
GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT JUST 
IN THE HUMAN SPACE, OR EVEN IN 
THE CELL SPACE TO UNDERSTAND 
HOW THE COMBINATION OF 
THERAPIES ARE GOING TO REFLECT 
THE BRAIN AND THE REST OF THE 
BODY IF YOU THINK ABOUT VCID 
AND ADIDS, AS A WHOLE BODY 
DISEASE SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE 
WE IMPROVE CLINICAL STUDIES IN 
ORDER TO FEED THAT INFORMATION 
INTO MORE APPROPRIATE CLINICAL 
TRIALS AND OBSOLETE A RESULT OF 
THOSE CAN GET FED BACK TO 
IMPROVE CLINICAL STUDIES. 
WITHOUT A WILL STOP. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. AGAIN A
PRIVILEGE 
TO BE PART OF THIS GROUP.
THESE ARE MY DISCLOSURES. 
&gt;&gt; DR. SESHADRI: I WILL BE
ADDRESSING HUMAN STUDY 
RECOMMENDATIONS 5 AND 6. 
IN RECOMMENDATION 5, WE 
ADVOCATE FOR ADVANCING 
INTERVENTIONS AND PREVENTION TO 
REDUCE VASCULAR DISEASE BY 
VASCULAR BRAIN INJURY IN 
POPULATIONS AT INCREASED RISK 
FOR VCID. 
THIS IS PRIORITY 2. 
SO WE ENCOURAGE PHASES 1-4 IN 
PRIMARY CLINICAL TRIALS OF VCID 
TESTING INTERVENTIONS SHOWN TO 
BE EFFICACIOUS IN REDUCING 
HEART ATTACKS AND STROKE.  THIS 
INCLUDES THINGS LIKE MANAGING 
BLOOD PRESSURES, DIABETES, 
OPTIMIZING DIET AND EXERCISE 
AND SLEEP ENVIRONMENT AND 
BEHAVIOR. AND THIS IS THE STAGE 
OF SOMEBODY WHO HAS NO REST 
BRAIN INJURY DETECTABLE, 
DRIVING PREVENTION IS PERHAPS 
SOMEBODY WHO HAS ALREADY HAD A 
STROKE.  AND AGAIN EMPHASIZING 
TRIALS AS WELL THAT IMPROVE 
QUALITY OF LIFE. 
FOR EXAMPLE IN PHYSICAL THERAPY 
INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE 
MUSCULAR STRENGTH, GATE AND 
BALANCE. 
WE ARE PRIORITIZING WHICH 
INTERVENTION SHOULD GO TO TRIAL 
CAN BE STRENGTHENED BY USING 
MEDICAL RELEVANT COHORTS THAT 
ARE NOW EXISTING. FOR EXAMPLE 
LOOKING AT COGNITION TWO YEARS 
AFTER AN ACUTE STROKE AND EVERY 
AND SEEING THE PREDICTORS, AND 
CONSEQUENCES AND PROGRESSION OF 
WHITE MATTER HYPER INTENSITY IN 
VCID. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THE RATIONALE FOR THIS 
RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT 
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES, 
WE HAVE A LOT OF OBSERVATIONAL 
DATA, ESPECIALLY FOCUSING ON 
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND 
DEMENTIA. NOT WHAT WE HOPE THEM 
PERHAPS TODAY THE MOST HOPEFUL 
ONE INTENSIVE BLOOD PRESSURE 
CONTROL IS SEEN 
(INDISCERNIBLE), IN PEOPLE WHO 
ARE ALREADY AT HIGH RISK. 
AND SO WE ARE RECOGNIZING 
THINGS LIKE, HOW EFFECT OF THE 
INTERVENTION?
WHAT IS THE STAGE OF THE 
DISEASE?
WHAT IS THE AGE OF THE PEOPLE 
WHO ARE IN THE STUDY?
WHAT IS THE TYPE OF 
INTERVENTION?
WHAT ARE THE MOLECULAR PATHWAYS 
THAT UNDERLIE AN EFFECTIVE OR 
INEFFECTIVE INTERVENTION?
AND SO THE HEART AND BRAIN ARE 
DIFFERENT TARGETS. 
WHAT ARE THE SUBJECTS LIKE 
SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTIC LIKE 
GENETICS, AND ENVIRONMENT?
WHAT IS THE COMBINATION OF 
THESE INTERVENTIONS THAT MAY BE 
SYNERGISTIC OR NOT?
ONE MAY ALSO NOT JUST LOOK AT 
THINGS LIKE BLOOD PRESSURE THAT 
WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEING CLINIC 
BUT FURTHER UPSTREAM. THINGS 
LIKE ARTERIAL STIFFNESS THAT 
HAVE A LONG-TERM EFFECT ON 
DEMENTIA RISK.  BUT PROCEED 
EVEN DETECTABLE HIGHER BLOOD 
PRESSURE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO, WHEN ONE THINKS ABOUT WHAT 
TO PRIORITIZE, THERE ARE THE 
VARIOUS MODIFIABLE RISK 
FACTORS, AS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE 
LANCET (PHONETIC) POPULATION 
THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT  A 
POPULATION AT RISK OR 
HIGHLIGHTED BY THE AHA AND 
THESE SEEM TO HAVE THE MAXIMUM 
IMPACT IN MIDLIFE. 
AND SO THE BENEFITS ARE NOT 
MAYBE DETECTABLE AS MUCH AS 20 
YEARS OR GREATER LATER.  AND AS 
YOU HEARD THROUGHOUT THIS, 
THESE RISK FACTORS MAY NOT ONLY 
BE ACTING THROUGH TRADITIONAL 
VASCULAR MECHANISMS, BUT TO 
THEIR IMPACT ON VARIOUS 
(INDISCERNIBLE) AND OTHER 
THINGS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO KEEPING THESE IN MIND, ONE 
DOES HAVE, HOWEVER, A LOT OF 
DATA TO MINE.  FOR EXAMPLE THIS 
NIH WEBSITE, YOU SEE THE 
VARIOUS LEGITIMATE DATA FROM 
AGE 10-100.  THE STUDY IS IN 
BLUE THAT ARE NEARLY 
OBSERVATIONAL, AS WELL AS ONES 
IN GREAY, INTERVENE TO CHANGE 
DIABETES RISK. THEN THE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HEART 
AND THE BRAIN  FOR EXAMPLE FOR 
HEART DISEASE ONE MAY NEED AT 
LEAST 30 MINUTES OF MODERATE TO 
AGGRESSIVE ACTIVITY TO REMOVE 
(INDISCERNIBLE). 
WHEN WE COMBINE THESE DATA SETS 
WITH BIOMARKERS THAT ARE ABLE 
TO BE SEEN IN AN AGNOSTIC 
MANNER YOU FIND THAT 
(INDISCERNIBLE) HIGHLIGHT NOVEL 
PATHWAYS LIKE CHANGES IN 
GLUTAMINE LEVELS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
NEXT. 
IN FACT, THERE ARE A LOT OF 
LARGE NUMBER OF-- EVEN IF YOU 
CONSIDER ONE MODALITY OF 
EXERCISE, A LARGE NUMBER OF 
(INDISCERNIBLE) THE RELEASE 
THAT HAVE AN EFFECT ON 
NEUROGENESIS AND ANGIOGENESIS, 
BUT THIS AFFECTS 
PERSON-TO-PERSON FOR EXAMPLE 
THE IMPACT OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 
ON MOOD OR COGNITION SEEMS TO 
VARY IN , ACUTE OR MORE CHRONIC 
SETTINGS BASED ON WHETHER THE 
PERSON IS HOMOZYGOTES OR 
(INDISCERNIBLE) CARRIER. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
ONE THING TO MULTIPLE 
INTERVENTIONS AGAIN SOME OF 
THESE LIKE IMPACTING OMEGA-3 
FATTY ACIDS, OR BLOOD PRESSURE 
CONTROL WERE NOT AFFECTED WITH 
-- EFFECTIVE FOR BLOOD PRESSURE 
CONTROL BUT NOT MUCH ADDITIONAL 
VALUE AND SO STUDIES ARE 
EXTENDING WHAT WAS DONE IN A 
SWEETIE SETTING TO A LARGE 
NUMBER OF HEALTH SYSTEMS AND 
PATIENT POPULATION TO SEE WHAT 
THE BENEFIT MIGHT BE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
RECOMMENDATION 6 THEREFORE 
EMPHASIZES LOOKING AT THE 
HETEROGENEITY, UNDERSTANDING 
THE IMPACT OF SPECIFIC, SMALL 
VESSEL DISEASE PATHOLOGIES AND 
VASCULAR RISK FACTORS OF 
COGNITIVE CHANGE DECLINE.  
RECOGNIZING THAT THESE 
HETEROGENEOUS PATHOLOGIES MAY 
CO-AUTHOR, MAY IMPACT THE 
POPULATION DEPENDING ON WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IN THE VASCULAR 
SETTING. 
AND WE WANT TO REALLY INTERVENE 
AT THE PRECLINICAL STAGE, WHEN 
THESE PATHOLOGIES ARE THERE BUT 
THEY ARE NOT HAVING ANY 
DISCERNIBLE EFFECT ON 
COGNITION. ANALOGOUS TO THE 
PRECLINICAL AMYLOID ARGUMENT 
ADDED IN AN ASSET WAS 
EMPHASIZED WE HAVE FEW NOVEL 
TARGETS EMPHASIZING THE VALUE 
ON THE BRAIN IN PARTICULAR. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND SO HOW CAN WE PERHAPS GET 
AROUND THAT?
YOU HAVE ALREADY HEARD THAT 
CATEGORIZING THE DIFFERENT 
SUBTYPES DEPENDS ON LOOKING AT 
THE STATUS OF THE HEART, THE 
BLOOD VESSELS, THE BLOOD-BRAIN 
BARRIER, LOW MRI MEASURES AND 
WHITE MATTER HYPER INTENSITY 
AND PERIVASCULAR SPACES. 
 BUT AS WE GET MORE SENSITIVE 
BIOMARKERS WHICH WILL HEAR 
ABOUT LATER WE ALSO HAVE THE 
QUESTION ABOUT WHAT IS THERE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND THERE ARE INTERACTIONS WITH 
THE, FOR EXAMPLE, 
POSTMENOPAUSAL STATUS, SO 
VASCULAR AND AMYLOID 
SYNERGISTICALLY ACT ON TAU 
ACCUMULATING THIS IN TURN 
MEDIATES THE COGNITIVE DECLINE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO, WHEN ONE TAKES A LUMPING 
APPROACH TO MAXIMIZE THE 
ABILITY TO FIND SMALL EFFECTS, 
ONE FINDS NEW BIOLOGICAL 
PATHWAYS.  ONE CAN UNDERSTAND 
THE CONTEXT IN BOTH THE 
CELLULAR AND -- LAST SLIDE 
PLEASE --  BOTH CELL AND 
SPATIAL LEVEL USING SINGLE CELL 
AND SPATIAL MIX. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
WE CONSIDER HOMOGENEOUS HYPER 
INTENSITY AS WELL, WHEN WE TAKE 
(INDISCERNIBLE) WE FIND THERE 
IS HETEROGENEITY OF BIOLOGY FOR 
EXAMPLE PERIVENTRIC OF 
SUBCORTICAL. 
CAN LEAD TO THE DETECTION OF 
NEW BIOLOGICAL PATHWAYS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THIS?
FOR EXAMPLE WE TALKED ABOUT NOT 
HAVING SPECIFIC TARGET FOR THE 
LYMPHATIC SYSTEM WHEN ONE TAKES 
PERIVASCULAR SPACES, IDENTIFIED 
UNDERLYING GENETICS, AND 
CORRELATES AND SEES WHAT ARE 
THE GENES WHOSE LEVELS ARE 
IMPACTED BY AVAILABLE, 
REPURPOSABLE DRUGS, THIS MAY 
LEAD TO NEW TARGETS FOR THE 
HUMAN TRACKS. 
THANK YOU.
NEXT. 
&gt;&gt; DR. LU: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. 
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
&gt;&gt; YES WE CAN. 
NOW WE CANNOT. 
&gt;&gt; WE LOST YOU. 
&gt;&gt; I COULD HEAR YOU
BEFORE. IF 
YOU ARE SPEAKING NOW, WE CANNOT 
HEAR YOU. 
&gt;&gt; THE SCREEN IS BLACK. 
&gt;&gt; YOU MAY HAVE TO LEAVE
AND 
OCME BACK. 
&gt;&gt; I THINK HE LEFT. 
WE WILL SEE HIM AGAIN SHORTLY. 
HE'S BACK. 
&gt;&gt; DR. LU: VERY SORRY
ABOUT 
THAT. 
&gt;&gt; YEAH WE HAVE YOU BACK. 
&gt;&gt; DR. LU: OKAY SORRY. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; DR. LU: NEXT. 
I HAVE NOTHING TO DISCLOSE. 
NEXT. 
SO, THE COMMITTEE MADE TO 
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO 
BIOMARKERS OF VCID. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 7 AND 8. 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE 
TWO LIES IN THE STAGE OF THE 
DEVELOPING PROCESS OF THE 
BIOMARKERS. I WANT TO NOTE THAT 
HERE, BY DIFFERENT STAGE AT ALL 
MEAN DISEASE SEVERITY STAGE. I 
MEAN INSTEAD DEVELOPMENT STAGE 
OF THE BIOMARKER PROCESS. 
SO RECOMMENDATION 7 IS TO 
DEVELOP AND VALIDATE CANDIDATE 
BIOMARKERS OF VCID IN 
PRECLINICAL MODELS AND 
HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS THAT SPAN 
THE TYPES OF BIOMARKERS 
ENCOMPASSING IMAGING, BIO 
FLUID, MULTI-OMIC, DIGITAL, AI, 
AND IN OTHER NOVEL BIOMARKERS, 
INCLUDING IN THE MOST COMMON 
SCENARIO WHERE VCID IS 
ACCOMPANIED BY BETA AMYLOID 
PLAQUES AND TAU TANGLES. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THERE ARE NO CURRENT VALIDATED 
BIOMARKERS FOR VCID. 
THE COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS THAT 
THE PROCESS TO DEVELOP VCID 
BIOMARKERS SPANS ACROSS THE 
RANGE OF STEPS AND PHASES. 
THIS RECOMMENDATION SUPPORT THE 
DISCOVERY AND EARLY STAGE OF 
IMPLEMENTING THE VALIDATION OF 
VCID BIOMARKERS. 
NX1
NEXT SLIDE. 
ONE CONSIDERATION IN THIS 
RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE 
COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO 
LEVERAGE FINDINGS FROM 
PRECLINICAL AND (INDISCERNIBLE) 
TO DEVELOP THE NEW BIOMARKERS. 
PRECLINICAL AND BASE STUDIES 
ACKNOWLEDGE THE MECHANISM OF 
VCID; SOME OF THEM IF THEY CAN 
BE MEASURED IN NONINVASIVE OR 
MINIMALLY INVASIVE CAN 
POTENTIALLY BE TRANSLATED TO 
BECOME BIOMARKERS. 
FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS PARTICULAR 
EXAMPLE WE MEASURE THE COVERAGE 
OF PARASITES, IMPORTANT TO THE 
ELEMENT OF NEUROVASCULAR UNIT. 
THEY SHOW THAT THIS PARASITE 
MEASUREMENT CAN BE STRONGLY 
CORRELATED TO SERUM BASED 
(INDISCERNIBLE), POTENTIAL 
(INDISCERNIBLE) FOR BIOMARKERS 
FOR VCID. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO, ANOTHER ASPECT THAT THE 
COMMITTEE CONSIDERED IS THEY 
WANT TO HAVE BIOMARKERS 
SPECIFIC TO CERTAIN TYPE OF 
SMALL VESSEL PATHOLOGY.
AS WE JUST HEARD A 
(INDISCERNIBLE) COMMON IN ADID. 
ACTUALLY VCID IS NOT ONE 
DISEASE. PATIENTS WHO HAVE 
DIFFERENT VASCULAR PATHOLOGIES, 
SO IS DESIRABLE FOR BIOMARKERS 
TO HAVE A SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIP 
TO A TYPE OF VASCULAR 
PATHOLOGY. 
AND THE PATHOLOGY, EXAMPLE SUCH 
AS -- ARTERIAL SCLEROSIS-- IN 
THIS EXAMPLE WE COULD 
POTENTIALLY SEE THAT AB 42 - 
ONE RATIO BETWEEN AB 42 AND 
BEETA  IS A MEASURE OF CSF CAN 
BE USED FOR THE PATHOLOGY OF 
THE A B PATHOLOGY MARKER. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO FAR, I WILL GIVE YOU 
EXAMPLES OF BIO FLUID WITH THE 
COMMITTEE ALSO RECOGNIZE WE 
SHOULD USE THE FULL SPECTRUM OF 
BIOMARKER TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE 
TO US. 
ONE EXAMPLE IS IMAGING.  IN 
THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE YOU CAN 
SEE THAT THESE INVESTIGATOR USE 
MI TO MEASURE (INDISCERNIBLE), 
AND THIS CAN PROVIDE A 
PHYSIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE 
LESION AND DAMAGE IN VCID 
PATIENTS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SIMILARLY,  THERE HAS BEEN 
TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN 
MULTI-OMIC TECHNOLOGY, AND SOME 
OF THIS IF THEY CAN BE 
(INDISCERNIBLE) TO THE 
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL THAT CAN BE 
LEVERAGED TO DO BE DEVELOPED AS 
A BIOMARKER FOR VCID. 
FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS REGULAR 
EXAMPLE INVESTING SHOW THAT 
TRANS MULTI-OMIC DATA CAN BE 
USED IN THE CELL PERI VASCULAR 
SPACE, SO THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN 
BE QUITE USEFUL FOR FUTURE 
DEVELOPMENT OF BIOMARKERS IN 
VCID. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
FINALLY THE COMMITTEE 
RECOGNIZED THAT THERE HAS BEEN 
TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND 
MACHINE LEARNING. THEREFORE 
THEY RECOMMEND TO USE AI 
MACHINE LEARNING IN ADVANCED 
MATHEMATICAL MODELING 
TECHNIQUES FOR ADVANCING THE 
BIOMARKERS IN THE VCID SPACE. 
AND THE GOAL IS TO HAVE MINIMAL 
EXPERIMENTAL DATA TO ACHIEVE 
THE HIGHEST SENSITIVITY AND 
SPECIFICITY FOR PATIENT 
BIOMARKER APPLICATION. 
IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE 
INVESTING IT IS USED A SMALL 
SIMPLE MI IMAGE TO USE MACHINE 
LEARNING AND SHOW THE VASCULAR 
DEMENTIA OR DISEASE REFLECT THE 
REASONS FOR DEMENTIA OR DISEASE 
PRIMARILY AFFECT THE 
HIPPOCAMPAL REGION. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
LET'S MOVE ON TO RECOMMENDATION 
8. TO CONDUCT STUDIES OF 
BIOMARKERS IN LATE STAGE OF 
DEVELOPMENT IN INSTRUMENTAL 
CLINICAL VALIDATION, DEFINING 
THE BIOMARKER CATEGORIES IN THE 
CONTEXT OF USE INCLUDING FOR 
EXAMPLE INTEGRATIVE ACTIVITIES 
OF DAILY LIVING, QUALITY OF 
LIFE METRICS WITH THE ULTIMATE 
GOAL OF REGULATORY APPROVAL. 
THIS IS PRIORITY NUMBER 1. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO WHAT IS THE RATIONALE HERE?
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROMISING 
CANDIDATE VCID BIOMARKERS. BUT 
FEW IF ANY HAVE REACHED THE 
LEVEL OF REGULAR TREE 
(CORRECTION) REGULATORY 
APPROVAL. 
WE KNOW THAT REGULATORY 
APPROVAL IS IMPORTANT. IT IS 
DESIRABLE TO HAVE ONE OR MORE 
OF THESE BIOMARKERS OF VCID TO 
CROSS THE FINISH LINE OF THE 
FDA APPROVAL OR QUALIFICATION.
AND ONCE AGAIN BORROWING FROM 
THE EXPERIENCE FROM -- IN THE 
AD FIELD, THE FIRST DEVELOPED 
AMYLOID AND TALL BIOMARKERS 
USED TO ACCELERATE THE 
TREATMENT. ONE OF THESE VCID 
BIOMARKERS CAN BE VALIDATED OR 
APPROVED THAT CAN HELP TO 
DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE LESS 
EXTENSIVE AND MORE ACCESSIBLE 
BIOMARKERS. IN THE AD SPACE, WE 
CAN SEE NEW PLASMA MARKERS THAT 
CAN BE DEVELOPED AND APPROVED 
USING THE EARLIER PET MARKER-- 
AS LONG AS WE CAN ONE OR MORE 
TRULY VALIDATED AND QUALIFIED 
APPROVED BIOMARKERS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
ONE PURSUIT OF THIS AT THIS 
LATE STAGE, ONE HAS TO HAVE 
CLINICAL VALIDATION OF THESE 
BIOMARKERS.  AND THERE ARE A 
FEW METRICS ONE CAN ASK IF YOU 
HAVE TWO RESEARCHERS TO PERFORM 
THE SAME ASSAY,  ON THE SAME 
PATIENT SAMPLES, DO THEY GET 
THE SAME RESULTS?
AND IT WOULD COME BACK AFTER A 
SHORT INTERVAL YOU CAN SEE 
WHETHER THE MEASURE IS 
COMPATIBLE OR CONSISTENT. 
SIMILARLY, IF YOU CAN DO MI 
MEASUREMENTS ON TWO DIFFERENT 
-- YOU CAN SEE WHETHER THE DATA 
YOU OBTAIN IS REPRODUCIBLE. 
CALLED INTER VENDOR 
REPRODUCIBILITY. 
AND SHOWS INSTRUMENTAL 
VALIDATION. AND IT SHOWS THE 
SCATTER PATTERN IS HOPEFULLY TO 
SHOW THE RESULT ON THE SAME 
LINE WITH LITTLE VARIATION IN 
THE SPACE TO MOVE TO FOR THE 
VALIDATION STEPS. 
THE COMMITTEE NOTED THAT THE 
FDA AND MH HAVE SOME GUIDELINES 
FOR BIOMARKER DEVELOPMENT AND 
THEY JOINTLY DEVELOP THESE 
BIOMARKERS END POINTS AND OTHER 
TOOLS. 
AND UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK THE 
DEFINED THE DIFFERENT 
CATEGORIES FOR BIOMARKERS. AND 
THERE ARE SEVEN POSSIBLE 
CATEGORIES. ACCESSIBILITY RISK, 
DIAGNOSTIC, MONITORING, 
PROGNOSTIC, PREDICTIVE, 
PHARMACODYNAMIC, AND SAFETY.
SO WHEN YOU HAVE A BIOMARKER 
FOR CONSIDERATION AND EVENTUAL 
APPROVAL BY THE REGULATORY 
AGENCIES, YOU WANT TO PUT THIS 
CATEGORY IN MIND. 
SIMILARLY YOU HAVE TO OPPOSE 
EACH BIOMARKER AND HAVE AT 
LEAST ONE IF NOT MORE CONTENT 
USE. CONSIDER INCLUSION, 
EXCLUSION CRITERIA IN THE TRIAL 
OR EVALUATING TREATMENT 
RESPONSE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND THE COMMITTEE NOTED THAT 
MOST OF THE CURRENT BIOMARKERS 
HAVE BEEN BASED ON 
OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES.  AND WE 
FELT IT WOULD BE USEFUL-- -- 
THE VALIDATION OF THE BIOMARKER 
IF THE BIOMARKER CAN ALSO BE 
TACIT IN SOME INTERVENTIONAL 
STUDIES. 
IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE, 
INVESTIGATORS USED  VASCULAR 
ACTIVITY -- AS THE PRIMARY 
OUTCOME BIOMARKER MEASURE TO 
EVALUATE A SUITE OF CLASSES OF 
HYPERTENSIVE DRUGS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND FINALLY, MOST OF THE 
VALIDATION WORK OF BIOMARKERS 
ABUSE CONTENT MEASURES, 
CLINICAL DIMENSION READING OR 
DIAGNOSTIC CATEGORIES. 
WE FELT IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO 
ALSO CONSIDER THINGS SUCH AS 
ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING, 
QUALITY OF LIFE METRICS. 
SO THESE METRICS HAVE BEEN 
INCLUDED IN THE NEW UDS OF THE 
SORT OF PROTOCOL. AND THEY HAVE 
SOMETHING CALLED "FUNCTIONAL 
ASSESSMENT SCALE," FAS. 
AND THE BENEFIT IS TO ACTIVATE 
-- (INDISCERNIBLE)  THE 
SPECIFIC TASKS IN OUR DAILY 
LIFE. WHETHER THEY ARE 
FUNCTIONING PROPERLY WHEN YOU 
PERFORM THESE DAILY LIFE 
FUNCTIONAL WORK. 
&gt;&gt; TWO MINUTES. 
&gt;&gt; DR. LU: THIS MEASURE 
REQUIRES LESS SKILLS AND 
TRAINING TO ADMINISTER. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO SHOWN HERIS AN ILLUSTRATION 
OF THE NACC UDS  FAS FORM AND 
THEY ASKED SPECIFIC QUESTION, 
YOU CAN PREPARE A BALANCED MEAL 
AND WHETHER (INDISCERNIBLE) SO 
THIS PERFORMANCE IS REALLY WHAT 
MATTERS TO OUR PATIENTS.  
THEREFORE IT IS USEFUL TO 
VALIDATE THE VCID BIOMARKER IN 
THE CONTEXT OF THESE DAILY LIFE 
PERFORMANCE MEASURES. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO, WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
SHOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS THEY 
WORK REALLY HARD AND MADE 
IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS DO THIS 
WORK AND I WOULD LIKE TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE THEM ONE MORE TIME. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
TO SUMMARIZE THESE AS THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE VCID 
COMMITTEE CAME UP WITH AS A 
REMINDER THEY ARE CATEGORIZED 
INTO FOUR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 1 AND 2, 
INVOLVING MAGNETIC STUDIES OF 
VCID AND RECOMMENDATION 4 MOVE 
TO TRANSLATION AND EXPANDING 
THE MECHANISM AND 5 AND 6, DEAL 
WITH HUMAN RELATED STUDIES SUCH 
AS INTERVENTION, TREATMENT AND 
THE DISEASE FROM THE HUMAN 
POINT OF VIEW. 
FINALLY RECOMMENDATIONS 7 AND 8 
DEAL WITH BIOMARKER DEVELOPMENT 
FROM EARLY-STAGE TO LATER STAGE 
EVENTUALLY HOPEFULLY TOWARDS 
REGULATORY APPROVAL. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU WILL GO TO 
QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. I 
ENCOURAGE EVERYONE ON THE 
COMMITTEE FOR THE VCID SESSION 
TO TURN ON YOUR CAMERAS. 
THE MICROPHONE SHOULD BE UNDER 
YOUR CONTROL TO TURN ON OR OFF. 
&gt;&gt; THE FIRST QUESTION. THE
FIRST IS FROM HELEN. 
&gt;&gt; HELLO, YES, I WAS
ACTUALLY 
GOING TO LOOK AT WHEN WE LOOK 
AT CONTRIBUTIONS TO YOU KNOW, 
NOT JUST  VASCULAR 
CONTRIBUTIONS BUT TO GENERAL 
DEMENTIA, ONE OF THE BEST 
PHRASES I HEARD FROM A 
CLINICIAN WHAT IN THE 
INDIVIDUAL NOT ONLY PHYSICALLY 
ENGAGED, OBVIOUSLY INTRODUCE 
EXERCISE. BUT SOCIALLY ENGAGED. 
AND IN MY WORK IN THE FIELD, I 
FIND THAT ISOLATION AND LACK OF 
SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT IS A HUGE 
CONTRIBUTOR. 
SO I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER 
THAT IS BEING LOOKED INTO, WHEN 
WE LOOK AT ALL OF THE FACTORS 
THAT MAY BE CONTRIBUTING. 
&gt;&gt; YEAH ABSOLUTELY. 
&gt;&gt; DR. FOSSATI: YOU WANT
TO 
COMMENT ON THIS? 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU HELEN FOR ALL
YOUR 
INSIGHTFUL COMMENTS IN YOUR 
ABSOLUTE RIGHT. 
BOTH THE DENSITY OF SOCIAL 
NETWORKS, AS WELL AS PERCEIVED 
LONELINESS SEEM TO HAVE AN 
IMPACT ON VASCULAR RISK, STROKE 
RISK, DEMENTIA RISK, AND GIVEN 
AN AMOUNT OF BRAIN INJURY, THE 
COGNITIVE FUNCTION. SO THE 
FUNCTIONAL LINK AS WELL AND 
THAT IS SOMETHING VERY 
IMPORTANT AND YOU CORRECTED 
POINTED OUT THAT THAT SHOULD BE 
MENTIONED AS SOMETHING TO TAKE 
INTO DIFFERENT PHASES OF 
TRIALS, AS WELL AS PRAGMATIC 
TRIALS. 
&gt;&gt; GREAT. 
THANK YOU SUDHA. 
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE ANOTHER?
I DON'T SEE ANOTHER. 
IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE 
UNMUTE YOURSELF. 
&gt;&gt; PRESS STAR 6.  TO ASK A
QUESTION.  GIVE IT A TRY. 
&gt;&gt; I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT
THE 
NEURON ITSELF. 
AND WHO ARE (CORRECTION) 
THROUGH THE PRESENTATIONS 
YESTERDAY AND TODAY WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT VARIOUS PROTEINS. 
YOU HAVE TAU AND YOU HAVE THE 
TDP 43 AND SO FORTH. 
AND WE TALKED ABOUT A-SYNUCLEIN 
TODAY.  ARE ALL OF THESE 
PROTEINS CURLED UP AND PACKED 
INTO THE NUCLEUS?
I KNOW THE TAU MOLECULE IS VERY 
LONG. IT CAN GET WRAPPED UP 
AGAINST ITSELF. WHEN IT DOES 
THAT IT SCREWS UP THE NEURON TO 
BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH 
OTHER NEURONS. 
AND THEN IT GETS WORRIED. IT 
THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG AND IT 
COMMITS SUICIDE.  AND YOU GET A 
WHOLE BUNCH OF THOSE HAPPENING. 
AND THEN YOU HAVE ... THE 
PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE DEALING 
WITH. 
ARE ALL OF THESE PROTEINS WE 
ARE TALKING ABOUT WRAPPED UP IN 
THE NUCLEUS ITSELF OF THE 
NEURON?
&gt;&gt; I CAN TAKE THIS IF YOU
WANT. 
 SO YES THAT IS A GREAT 
QUESTION. 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MULTIPLE 
PATHOLOGIES. RIGHT?
WE ARE AFFECTING THE NEURONS 
FROM MULTIPLE SIDES AND ALL OF 
THESE PATHOLOGIES COME IN 
DIFFERENT FLAVORS WE CAN SAY. 
SO WE HAVE TAU, YES, A PROTEIN 
THAT (INDISCERNIBLE) AN ESCAPE 
FROM THE NEURON. TRANSFERS FROM 
CELL TO CELL AND GOES TO OTHER 
CELLS. 
AMYLOID BETA MOSTLY PRODUCED 
FROM INSIDE THE (INDISCERNIBLE) 
IT GOES OUT IN THE BRAIN AND 
FORMS PLAQUES IN THE MATRIX, IN 
THE BRAIN, IN THE EXTRACELLULAR 
SPACES. 
WE ARE TALKING IN OUR CASES OF 
VASCULAR PATHOLOGY. VERY 
IMPORTANT FOR NEURON FUNCTION. 
WE HAVE TO CONSIDER THAT WE 
LOSE BLOOD FLOW. THAT IS WHAT 
GIVES NEURONS THE OXYGEN, THE 
GLUCOSE, ALL THE FUNCTIONAL 
SUBSTANCES TO MAKE THEM LIVE 
AND SURVIVE AND THRIVE.
 AND SO ALL OF THESE 
PATHOLOGIES ACTING DIFFERENT 
WAYS INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE 
NEURONS.  BUT SOMEHOW THEY WILL 
AFFECT THEM. THAT IS WHY WE END 
UP WITH DEMENTIA. 
AND WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW 
EACH PATHOLOGY SPECIFICALLY 
AFFECTED NEURON. THAT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT. 
&gt;&gt; WELL IT CERTAINLY
FOLLOWS 
THE ... EXAMPLE THAT IS 
SOMETIMES GIVEN. BLIND PEOPLE 
LOOKING AT AN ELEPHANT, GETTING 
ONE PIECE TO LOOK AT AND THEN 
ANOTHER PIECE, AND DESCRIBE 
WHAT THEY SEE. 
NOW THIS IS REALLY TINY STUFF 
YOU ARE LOOKING AT.  I DID NOT 
UNDERSTAND THAT TAU FOR EXAMPLE 
MIGRATE OUT OF THE NEURON, 
FLOATING AROUND AMONGST THE 
MICROGLIA CELLS AND SO FORTH. 
ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW, TRYING TO 
TRACK ALL THAT STUFF IS MIND 
BLOWING. I AM JUST A REGULAR 
GUY. 
I WANT TO SAY I REALLY 
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. 
AND MS. MCCARTHY, THANK YOU FOR 
FIXING ME UP, SO AT LEAST I CAN 
ASK A QUESTION OF THESE FOLKS. 
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW MY ... 
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM ISN'T SO 
GOOD. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
&gt;&gt; HI, THANK YOU. PERFECT 
SESSION. APOLOGIES IF I MISSED 
THIS. 
WONDERING WHERE IN THE 
RECOGNITION WE WOULD FIND 
(INDISCERNIBLE) ISSUES,  
PARTICULARLY THINKING OF TWO 
EXAMPLES. MAYBE THIS IS NOT 
COUNT AS EXPOSURE BECAUSE IT IS 
IN AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, 
EXPOSURE COLLECT SOME STRESS 
AND A VARIETY OF ISMS, AND THE 
OTHER IS MORE ON COVID. 
&gt;&gt; DR. FOSSATI: THERE IS A
WHOLE SESSION IN JUNE THAT 
FOCUSES ON EXPOSURE.  AS YOU 
KNOW TWO YEARS AGO THERE WAS A 
WHOLE SESSION ON COVID AND I 
NOW INFECTIONS INCLUDING 
SARS-COVID-2 AND INFORMATION 
AND (INDISCERNIBLE) RESPONSES 
WOVEN INTO THIS AND WILL BE 
PART OF THE EXPOSURE SESSION. 
&gt;&gt; BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT
YEAH, 
WE PROBABLY HAVE TO COORDINATE 
WITH THE EXPOSURE SESSION TO 
MAKE SURE WE ALSO INCLUDE THESE 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THAT EFFECT 
SPECIFICALLY ON VCID. YEAH, 
THAT IS SOMETHING TO NOTE. 
&gt;&gt; I WILL ADD THAT WE
THINK 
ABOUT BUILDING MORE COMPLEX 
MODELS THAT MORE TRULY REFLECT 
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE HUMAN 
CONDITION, YOU WANT TO START 
WITH GENETICS.  THE ALSO WANT 
TO COMBINE GENETICS WITH 
ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES.  AND 
BY DOING THAT BY UNDERSTANDING 
HOW YOU BUILD THEM, YOU 
UNDERSTAND HOW YOU MIGHT BE 
ABLE TO FIX THEM. AND WHAT THE 
MECHANISMS ARE. THE 
CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE EXPOSEM 
(PHONETIC),   IT IS A CRITICAL 
COMPONENT IN MANY CASES AND YOU 
MAKE A GENETIC MANY RELATION IN 
THE MODEL AND IT DOES NOT GO 
FAR ENOUGH. BUT INCREASES 
SUSCEPTIBILITY WHEN YOU COMBINE 
THAT WITH A HIGH-FAT DIET, AND 
EXPOSURE TO STRESS. YOU CAN 
PUSH THE PHENOTYPE MORE TOWARDS 
THE DISEASE. 
TICKLY AS WE THINK ABOUT IN A 
MULTI-OMICS APPROACH YEAR, IF 
YOU CAN ALIGN YOUR MODELS NOT 
SO MUCH DOES IT HAVE A 
PATHOLOGY YES OR NO, WHAT ARE 
THE MOLECULAR CHANGES? 
WE HAVE MULTI-OMICS, AND 
THERE'S A LOT MORE WE CAN DO IN 
CREATING BETTER MODELS AND 
ALIGNING THEM AT THE LEVEL OF 
PROTEIN GENES AND THE METABOLIC 
CHANGES. 
&gt;&gt; I APPRECIATE THE
REMINDER 
THAT WE HAVE A SESSION IN JUNE. 
WHICH FEELS LIKE A LONG WAY 
AWAY ABOUT EXPOSUM. (PHONETIC). 
I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUR 
WORKGROUP AND EACH OF THE OTHER 
DISEASE SPECIFIC WORK GROUPS TO 
THINK ABOUT EMBEDDING LANGUAGE 
TO SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS, AND 
NOT LEADING TO THE CROSSCUTTING 
ALONG. I WORRY THAT IN THE 
ENVIRONMENT THAT NIH IS FACING 
IN THE MONTH YEARS AHEAD IT 
COULD BE LOST. AND IT COULD BE 
BETTER IF IT WERE IN THREE OR 
FOUR PLACES RATHER THAN JUST 
ONE. 
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF THE RISK
FACTORS 
AND EXPOSURES, FOR EXAMPLE 
SLEEP-DISORDERED SO 
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CAN 
AFFECT VASCULAR DISEASE. AND 
VASCULAR DISEASE AFFECTS VCID.  
SO THEY ARE ALL LINKED 
TOGETHER, DEFINITELY. 
&gt;&gt; LET'S MOVE ON TO --
NAPHALI?
&gt;&gt; YES, I HEARD WHEN THE 
COMMENTS ABOUT THE 
PROTEINOPATHY TO BE THE CORE OF 
DEMENTIA-CAUSING DISEASES.  IN 
REFERENCE TO THAT I WANTED TO 
ADD MY COMMENT. SO IN 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATHOLOGY, 
WHEN WE TAKE A SECTION OF THE 
BRAIN AFFECTED BY ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE, WE NOT ONLY SEE THE 
PLAQUES THAT ARE FORMED WITHIN 
THE CORTEX BUT WE SEEN THEM 
ALSO ON THE VESSELS.  WHICH IS 
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE AN 
EVIDENCE THAT ONE MORE 
EVIDENCE, SHOWING THAT THIS 
COULD BE ALSO A VASCULAR 
PATHOLOGY. 
MAYBE PLAQUE MAYBE THE 
PROTEINOPATHY IS TOUCHING ONE 
ELEMENT AND MISSING THE REST. I 
WANTED TO ADD THIS. 
&gt;&gt; TOTALLY RIGHT WHICH
IS-- 
WHAT YOU DESCRIBE THE POSITION 
AROUND THE VESSELS IS ONE OF 
THE MAIN PATHOLOGICAL FEATURES 
OF VCID.  IT IS ONE OF THE MAIN 
FOCUSES OF OUR MECHANISTIC 
STUDIES, TOGETHER WITH OTHER 
VASCULAR PATHOLOGIES. THANK 
YOU. 
&gt;&gt; ANOTHER PART OF THE
BLIND 
METAPHOR SO YOU MENTIONED 
MULTIPLE PATHOLOGIES. YOU PUT 
(INDISCERNIBLE) YOU INCREASE 
THE AMOUNT OF CAA AND SOME ALSO 
FOLLOWING THE ELEPHANT ANALOGY, 
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE 
ELEPHANT. 
&gt;&gt; NEXT WE HAVE --. 
GREG?
&gt;&gt; FANTASTIC.
REPRESENTATIONS 
AND GREAT SUMMARIES. NICE TO 
SEE SOME OF YOU THAT HAVE NOT 
SEEN SO LONG AND OTHERS I HAVE 
SEEN MORE RECENTLY. 
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CONCEPTS 
AND PLEASE THROW VIRTUAL 
TOMATOES AT ME IF I MISSED 
THIS. 
ONE OF THE ISSUES WE REALLY 
STRUGGLED WITH ARE THESE 
MULTIPLE ETIOLOGIES OFTEN 
AFFECTING DIFFERENT REGIONS OF 
THE BRAIN SO A LOT OF VASCULAR 
DISEASE BURDEN IS FOUND 
SUBCORTICALLY (INDISCERNIBLE) 
-- BUT BEGINNING TO BRING 
TOGETHER HOW DO THESE DISEASES 
INTERACT WHEN THEY ARE 
REGIONALLY IN DIFFERENT AREAS?
AND REALLY BEGINNING TO 
INVESTIGATE THAT.  I REALLY SEE 
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY 
IMPORTANT. 
WE TALK ABOUT VASCULAR DISEASE 
BURDEN AS IF IT WERE EQUIVALENT 
THROUGHOUT ALL AREAS OF THE 
BRAIN.  WE KNOW THAT IS VERY 
DIFFERENT, THE SAME AS WITH 
TDP-43, A-SYNUCLEIN, TAU AND/OR 
AMYLOID. 
AND TELL ME WHEN YOU'RE WORKING 
GROUP HOW MUCH DISCUSSION, AND 
IS THAT BUILDING TO ANY OF YOUR 
RECOMMENDATIONS?
&gt;&gt; DR. LU: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH 
FOR THIS QUESTION.  SO THE 
COMMITTEE DID TALK ABOUT USING 
MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGIES, 
ESPECIALLY TECHNOLOGY LOOKING 
AT ALL ASPECTS OF THE DISEASE 
BIOLOGY AND ALSO CONSIDERING 
(INDISCERNIBLE), AND OTHER 
TYPES OF PROTEIN OPPOSITE IN 
THIS REGARD I FEEL IMAGING 
BIOMARKER CAN PLAY PARTICULARLY 
USEFUL ROLE IN THE SENSE THAT 
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE ENTIRE 
BRAIN AND BIO FLUID AND LOOK AT 
THE ENTIRE BRAIN AND LOCALIZE 
FOR INSTANCE FRONTAL LOBE 
VERSUS CAA WHICH IS MORE 
OCCIPITAL LOBE AND BIO MATTER 
IS MORE CLASSICAL  VASCULAR 
DISEASE SO THAT DEEP NUCLEUS. 
SO BRINGING TOGETHER THIS 
IMAGING TECHNOLOGY CAN 
POTENTIALLY TEASE APART THE 
MIXED CONTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT 
PATHOLOGIES TO THE PARTICULAR 
PERSON. 
&gt;&gt; I WONDER IF DAVID WANTS
TO 
ADD SOMETHING TO THAT?
THAT IS DEFINITELY AN AREA HE 
HIGHLIGHTS IN A GREAT EMAIL 
EARLIER TODAY. 
&gt;&gt; I WILL ADD WHILE DAVID,
IF 
YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING IN A 
MOMENT -- I WONDER IF THIS IS 
GOING TO REFLECT THE EXPANSION 
OF AI CAPABILITIES. I IT WILL 
HELP A LOT HERE TAKING THESE 
DATA SETS AND -- HAS 
EXPERIENCED MACHINE LEARNING 
AND APPLYING THOSE TO LOOK AT 
MORE REGIONAL CHANGES. CLEARLY 
AN IMPORTANT AREA TO STUDY. 
&gt;&gt; IF I COULD CHIME IN
JUST 
QUICKLY. THAT WAS A GREAT POINT 
ABOUT LOOKING AT MANY REGIONS 
THROUGHOUT THE BRAIN.  AND I 
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF 
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE COMING TO 
THE POINT THAT THEY COULD BE 
USEFUL. 
MY CONCERN GOING FORWARD IS WE 
HAVE GOOD MOLECULAR MARKERS, 
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE GOOD 
FLORESCENT DIES OR DIES THAT 
HAVE CONTRAST UNDER ULTRASOUND. 
AND THIS SHOULD ALLOW US TO DO 
LONGITUDINAL STUDIES ON THE 
PROGRESSION OF DISEASE. MORE 
SO, ALLOW US TO PROBE 
MODULATORY REGIONS AND MIDRANGE 
REGIONS FUNDAMENTAL FOR FACIAL 
ACTIONS, DAILY LIFE. 
I THE TECHNOLOGY FROM THE POINT 
OF VIEW OF MARKERS AND FROM 
INSTRUMENTATION HAS BEEN 
SHOOTING UP IN THE LAST FEW 
YEARS. THIS COULD HAVE A BIG 
IMPACT ON VCID MEASUREMENTS AND 
MODELS. 
&gt;&gt; I CAN ADD TO THAT. 
THE REGIONALITY IS SUCH AN 
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF SMALL 
VESSEL DISEASE. CAA AFFECT 
DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE BRAIN 
COMPARED TO ARTERIOSCLEROSIS, 
AND SO WE LOOK AT DIFFERENT 
REGIONS OF THE BRAIN, WE CAN 
ACTUALLY PARSE OUT UNDERLYING 
ETIOLOGIES. IN FACT WE HAVE 
USED MACHINE LEARNING TO DO 
CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS TO TRY TO 
DISTINGUISH PATTERNS OF LIGHT, 
OR HYPER INTENSITIES RAISED IN 
THE UNDERLYING ETIOLOGY. THAT 
IS BEEN A PRODUCTIVE APPROACH 
TO PHENOTYPING WHITE MATTER 
HYPER INTENSITIES. GREAT 
QUESTION. THANKS. 
&gt;&gt; THERE IS ONE MORE
QUESTION. 
GABE?
&gt;&gt; YEAH DR. SESHADRI
MENTIONED 
ARTERIAL  STIFFNESS AND 
HYPERTENSION -- IS THAT 
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE 
CONCENTRATED ASIDE FROM THESE 
STRUCTURAL BELLS AND WHISTLES, 
THE FUNCTIONAL PART OF WHAT IS 
CONTROLLING A WHAT BECOMES 
INTERRUPTED THAT CAUSES THE 
DILATION-- CAUSES THE BLOOD 
PRESSURE TO GO UP WHICH IS 
DEFINITELY LINK TO THE SYSTEMIC 
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, 
DEMENTIA AND DEATH. 
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT PLEASE?
&gt;&gt; I CAN TAKE THAT. 
SO IN THE MOCK VCID STUDY THAT 
I HAPPEN TO BE INVOLVED WITH, 
WE ARE MEASURING THIS DILATION 
CAPACITY AND IN THIS CASE WE 
USED COMMON DIOXIDE AS A BASAL 
STIMULUS. AND WE MEASURE HOW TO 
EXTEND (INDISCERNIBLE) AND 
DILATE.  THIS IS SOMETHING WE 
ARE ACTUALLY PURSUING. THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS QUESTION.
&gt;&gt; YES, DAVID? 
&gt;&gt; DR. FARDO: IF I COULD
ADD TO 
THAT IT IS A GREAT QUESTION. 
GOING BACK TO THE 1980S, THERE 
WAS THIS SORT OF HYPOTHESIS 
THAT BASICALLY WHAT VESSELS , 
ARE DILATING AS YOU POINT OUT 
THEY ARE NATURALLY DILATING DUE 
TO VASAL MOTION, ALMOST A 20% 
DILATION ABOUT ONCE EVERY 20 
SECONDS, IN ADDITION TO 
DILATION THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH 
INCREASED SENSORY STIMULUS. 
AND ... (AUDIO CUTTING OUT)... 
YOU HAVE STICKY BLOOD VESSELS. 
IN FACT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO 
EXTRUDE PROTEINS FROM THE BRAIN 
THESE ARE CALLED MIXTURE MODELS 
EARLY ON. IF YOU WANT TO THINK 
OF IT OF SORT OF A WASHING 
MACHINE, NOT THAT FAR FROM THE 
PHYSICAL TRUTH. 
AND THE POINT YOU BRING UP IS 
VERY IMPORTANT.  AND AGAIN THIS 
IS SOMETHING WE CAN GET A 
BETTER HANDLE ON WITH NOT -- 
WITH MINIMALLY INVASIVE, 
LONGITUDINAL MEASUREMENTS AND 
POST MARKERS. 
&gt;&gt; ALSO, WHAT
INTERVENTIONS CAN 
IMPROVE VASODILATION?
&gt;&gt; DR. FARDO: MAYBE.
MAYBE.
&gt;&gt; LIKE BLOCKING ANGIO
TENSION 
-- PART OF MY LIFE. 
&gt;&gt; DR. FARDO: SOME OF THE 
HYPERTENSIVE DRUGS HAVE 
INTENSIVE, AND I SUPPOSE THEY 
WILL IMPROVE THE VASAL 
REACTIVITY. 
&gt;&gt; EXPLAINS WHY THE MUCUS 
LOWERING DRUGS SEEM TO BE 
HAVING AN IMPROVED EFFECT ON 
REDUCING DEMENTIA?
STIRS INFORMATION 
(INDISCERNIBLE) ... FIBROSIS 
CARRIES VASAL DILATION. 
&gt;&gt; I THAT IS VERY COMPLEX
THOSE 
DRUGS INTERACT IN MANY 
DIFFERENT WAYS. THAT COULD BE 
ONE OF THEM. 
WE HAVE TO GET THE PIPELINE 
GOING. WE HAVE A LOT OF DRUGS 
IN THE PRECLINICAL STAGE AND I 
CAN TELL YOU IN MY LAP FOR 
EXAMPLE THE DO EXACTLY THAT THE 
IMPROVE HYPERACTIVITY TOGETHER 
WITH OTHER THINGS SUCH AS 
IMPROVING METABOLIC AND 
MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION AND WE 
HAVE TO GET INTO THE CLINICAL 
STAGE. 
SO THE TRANSLATIONAL 
RECOMMENDATIONS EXACTLY SAY 
THAT.  TO KIND OF FACILITATE 
THAT TRANSITION. 
&gt;&gt; SO IT IS REALLY 
MULTI-ELASTICAL?
THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; WE ARE OUT OF TIME FOR 
QUESTIONS FOR THIS SESSION.
SO WE WILL MOVE STRAIGHT INTO 
THE NEXT SESSION WHICH IS THE 
FURTHER PUBLIC INPUT. 
WE THANKED THIS COMMITTEE. 
WE HAVE A SLOW START TO THE 
NEXT SESSION BECAUSE, ANYBODY 
NEEDS TO GET UP AND STRETCH AND 
THEN COME BACK, WE WILL BE HERE 
FOR THE NEXT HOUR WITH OPEN 
MICROPHONE FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD 
LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING. 
AND DAVID, I SEE YOUR HAND. 
&gt;&gt; NO, NO. MY HAND IS NOT
UP. I 
WAS THANKING MY COLLEAGUES FOR 
A GREAT PRESENTATION. 
&gt;&gt; FOR THE SESSION WE ONLY
HAVE 
ONLY 25 OPEN CAMERAS. RIGHT?
SHOULD WE ...
&gt;&gt; WE WILL LET EVERYBODY,
SO 
ALL THE SPEAKERS FOR THE LAST 
TWO DAYS ARE SETTING UP SO YOUR 
CAMERA AND MICROPHONE ARE UNDER 
YOUR CONTROL SO THERE ENABLED 
WHETHER YOU JOIN AS A PRESENTER 
OR AN ATTENDEE TODAY. WE WILL 
BE ACTIVELY TRYING TO SPOTLIGHT 
PEOPLE ON THE SCREEN SO THE 
SPEAKERS ARE POPPING UP TO THE 
FRONT, BUT THERE ARE LIMITS. WE 
CAN ONLY SPOTLIGHT SEVEN AT A 
TIME. FEEL FREE TO USE YOUR 
MICROPHONE AND CAMERA.
AND I THINK WE HAVE THAT ALL 
SET UP ALREADY. 
&gt;&gt; WHAT A GREAT JOB HAVE
DONE 
ON MAKING THIS VIRTUAL SESSION 
FEEL SO REAL AND PRODUCTIVE. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
THAT 
FEEDBACK. 
IT IS A BIG TEAM. 
I'M GOING TO ... HAND IT OVER 
TO KATE POSSIN. 
&gt;&gt; DR. POSSIN: I HOPE
EVERYBODY 
HAD A GENESIS STRETCH AS WE GOT 
INTO THE LAST SESSION TODAY BUT 
BEFORE WE START I WANT TO MAKE 
SURE EVERYONE IS AWARE THERE IS 
A THIRD DAY OF THE SUMMIT. 
GOING TO BE ON JUNE 2. TODAY WE 
WANT TO HEAR YOUR COMMENTS BUT 
IF YOU DO NOT TELL US YOUR 
COMMENTS TODAY OR SOMETHING 
OCCURS LATER, THERE IS ANOTHER 
CHANCE. PLEASE JOIN US ON JUNE 
2 AND PROVIDE INPUT THERE. 
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR AMBER 
MCCARTNEY. 
IS THERE A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO 
EMAIL FEEDBACK BETWEEN THE 
MEETINGS?
&gt;&gt; THERE WILL NOT BE A
LIVE  
FEEDBACK BUTTON ACTIVE IN 
BETWEEN BUT YOU CAN EMAIL ... 
QUESTIONS TO ME. 
I CAN HELP YOU FIND THE RIGHT 
PERSON FIVE NOT THE RIGHT 
PERSON TO ASK. FEEL FREE TO 
REACH OUT TO ME. MY EMAIL 
ADDRESS IS 
AMBER.MCCARTNEY@NIH.GOV.
WE WILL FOLLOW-UP WITH EVERYONE 
WHO ATTENDED TODAY WITH A LINK 
TO JOIN THE MEETING HOW THE 
SECOND, AND THE UPDATED AGENDA 
AND PROGRAM BOOK. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU THAT IS VERY 
HELPFUL AND I SEE WE HAVE OUR 
FIRST QUESTION. 
SO I AM NOT-- I CANNOT SEE YOU 
NEVER WOULD YOU UNMUTE YOURSELF?
IS YOUR NAME DEBBIE YELPS? 
(PHONETIC)
&gt;&gt; NO. 
&gt;&gt; I SEE MARICE FIRST. 
&gt;&gt; I AM NEUROSCIENTIST.
THIS IS 
A QUESTION AS I HAVE BEEN 
TRACKING YOUR PRESENTATIONS 
WHICH I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED. 
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT 
MULTI-ETIOLOGY, I'M WONDERING 
IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
ULTIMATE OR PROXIMATE. ARE WE 
TALKING ABOUT TAU VS. AMYLOID 
VS. LEVY BODIES?
I WOULD TALK ABOUT HEART 
FAILURE OR MAYBE OBESITY?
MAYBE BECAUSE I AM NOT A 
CLINICIAN BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
IT MEANS TO HAVE MULTIPLE 
ETIOLOGY. 
&gt;&gt; THIS IS SUDHA, I LIKE
TO 
PASS IT TO YOU. 
&gt;&gt; DR. SESHADRI: WHEN WE
USED 
TO MAKE A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS 
BASED ON THE PREPONDERANCE OF 
THE CLINICAL EVIDENCE, A LOT OF 
THE TIME WHEN WE COMPARE THAT 
WITH WHAT WE SEE AT THE BRAIN 
(INDISCERNIBLE), AS YOU SAID WE 
ARE SEEING THINGS THAT MIGHT BE 
SUFFICIENT IN THEMSELVES TO 
CAUSE THE SYMPTOMS. 
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE A 
FULL PROOF WAY TO KNOW THAT 
YOUR SYMPTOMS ARE BECAUSE OF 
THIS OR THAT. 
IF SOMEBODY HAS AMYLOID, TAU, 
(INDISCERNIBLE) AND ALL OF THE 
ABOVE SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
PATHOLOGIES THAT WE THINK EACH 
CAN LEAD TO COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT AND DEMENTIA. AND 
THE COEXISTENCE OF THESE. 
BASED ON THE WAY WE CAME WE CAN 
SOMETIMES SAY OKAY, YOU HAVE 
HALLUCINATIONS, WE THINK THIS 
WAS PERHAPS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THIS BUT IF SOMEBODY HAS 
DIFFICULTY WITH PLANNING AND 
EXECUTION, WAS IT BECAUSE OF 
THE TAU?
WAS IT BECAUSE OF THE 
A-SYNUCLEIN?
THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS SUPER HELPFUL.
THANK 
YOU SO MUCH. 
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. 
DEBBIE?
&gt;&gt; IS THERE ANYONE ELSE
WHO 
WANTS TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION?
&gt;&gt; HI EVERYBODY, SUDHA I
LOVE 
YOUR ANSWER. MY VOICE IS NOT 
TOO GREAT BUT OVER TIME IT HAS 
BEEN AS SUDHA SAID, RECOGNIZE 
THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE 
PATHOLOGIES THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE 
TO DEMENTIA. 
AND I A LITTLE BIT OF THE 
CHALLENGE, OF KNOWING WHAT TO 
SAY IS THAT WE'RE ON THE PATH 
TO CERTAINTY OF WHICH OF THOSE 
PATHOLOGIES ARE ACTUALLY 
CAUSAL. 
OR WHETHER IT IS SOMETHING THAT 
IS UPSTREAM OF THE PATHOLOGY 
THAT IS CAUSAL.  AND WHEN YOU 
HAVE-- AND THOSE THREE 
DIFFERENT PATHOLOGIES IN THE 
BRAIN ALL OF WHICH MAY BE 
CONTRIBUTING, BUT ALSO ALL OF 
WHICH MIGHT BE KIND OF ALONG 
FOR THE RIDE, OR DOWNSTREAM. IT 
GETS VERY HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO 
SAY. IF THAT MAKES SENSE. 
SO A MIXED-ETIOLOGY DEMENTIA, 
WE ARE REFERRED TO IS A BIT OF 
AN OBLIQUE WAY OF ACKNOWLEDGING 
THERE IS A LOT WE DON'T KNOW.  
AND THAT INCLUDES OUR 
UNDERSTANDING OF CAUSES. 
&gt;&gt; AND IF I MIGHT JUST
ASK, 
WOULD YOU SAY THINGS LIKE, "I 
DON'T KNOW BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER 
INTEGRITY, NEURO- 
INFLAMMATION." YOU DON'T KNOW 
YET IF THEY ARE UPSTREAM, 
CAUSAL, ETC.?
&gt;&gt; YEAH.  I WOULD SAY IT
LIKE 
THEY ARE CERTAINLY IN THE 
PICTURE. THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE 
IMPORTANT. BUT IN TERMS OF 
HARD-BOILED, RIGOROUS PROOF, 
THAT IS WHAT PUTS US IN THIS 
SPACE OF SAYING THINGS LIKE 
MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY. 
I MIGHT REPHRASE IT AND SAY, 
MULTIPLE PATHOLOGY DEMENTIA. 
MY PERSPECTIVE WHAT THAT COME 
FROM IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE SEE 
MULTIPLE PATHOLOGIES IN 
ABSTAINING THAT IS WHAT IS 
RECOGNIZE BUT THAT IS MY TWO 
BITS. 
&gt;&gt; AND IF I CAN ADD
SOMETHING 
TO WHAT DAVE BEAUTIFULLY SAID, 
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS CAUSAL. 
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THINGS 
MAY BE CAUSAL TO EACH OTHER IN 
A FEET-FORWARD LOOK. FOR 
EXAMPLE VERY PER MOBILITY AND 
INFLAMMATION CAN BE CAUSAL TO 
COGNITIVE FUNCTION BUT ALSO 
(INDISCERNIBLE), SO IS A LITTLE 
BIT OF A (INDISCERNIBLE). 
&gt;&gt; ALICE, IF YOU WANT TO 
COMMENT ON THIS?
OR SOMETHING ELSE?
&gt;&gt; YEAH I WANTED TO SAY I
DO 
LIKE QUESTION VERY MUCH. 
BECAUSE I IT GET TO THE FACT 
THAT WE ARE SPEAKING ON TWO 
LEVELS. RIGHT?
WE ARE SPEAKING ON THE CLINICAL 
LEVEL AND ALSO SPEAKING AT A 
MECHANISTIC SCIENTIFIC LEVEL. 
AT A CLINICAL LEVEL WHOM WE ARE 
TALKING TO PATIENT WE ARE 
THINKING ABOUT THE HEAD INJURY. 
YOU KNOW?
BASICALLY THE LITTLE STROKE. 
THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT AS ETIOLOGIES.  
BUT WHEN WE ARE THINKING ABOUT 
THIS MECHANISTICALLY-- AND WE 
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT 
MECHANISTICALLY IF WE ARE 
TRYING TO TARGET AND DEVELOP 
THERAPIES-- INFERRING THAT 
CAUSE, THE STROKE, THE HEAD 
INJURY MAY LEAD TO SOMETHING. 
ESSENTIALLY IN THE CASE OF THE 
HEAD INJURY MAY BE TAU. 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 
AND THAT I IS THE FIRST THING. 
THE WAY ETIOLOGIES HAVE BEEN 
USED IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS 
ACROSS DIFFERENT PRESENTATIONS. 
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF TRYING 
TO INTERRUPT THEM WE HAVE TO 
THINK LIKE SCIENTISTS, THINKING 
ABOUT THE MECHANISTIC PIECES. 
AND I DO THINK SOME OF THE 
CAUSALITY CAN BE HELPED BY THE 
FACT THAT THERE IS A LOT OF 
GENETICS AND GENOMICS TOO.  
THAT INFERS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF 
CAUSALITY THERE. 
&gt;&gt; DEBBIE?
PLEASE UNMUTE AND ASK YOUR 
QUESTION OR COMMENT. 
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY? 
&gt;&gt; YES. 
&gt;&gt; SO THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR 
THIS WONDERFUL UPDATE ON ALL 
THE WORK STREAMS THAT HAVE BEEN 
HAPPENING. 
IT REALLY IS HEARTENING, 
ESPECIALLY TO HEAR THE PEOPLE 
WHO PRESENTED WHAT HAS EMERGED 
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS, SINCE 
THE LAST SUMMIT. 
I LOST MY HUSBAND TO A GENERIC 
(INDISCERNIBLE) DISEASE IN THE 
RIVERS AND FAMILIES WHO HAVE 
LOST LOVED ONES TO SPORADIC AND 
GENETIC. 
ONE THING I DID NOT HEAR IN THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE 
PRIORITIES IN THE WORK TEAMS, 
IS REPRESENTATION OF PREOM 
(PHONETIC) DISEASE AND WHEN WE 
ARE LOOKING TO RUB TOGETHER SO 
MUCH IS HAPPENING IN SO MANY 
DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS, TO ME 
THAT FEELS LIKE A LOSS. 
SO MY COMMENT IS, COULD THAT BE 
CONSIDERED AS YOU PROCEED WITH 
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS?
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU DEBBIE. THAT
WAS 
VERY WELL SAID. 
AMBER, I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN 
SOME HISTORY ABOUT INCLUDING 
PREON HERE. SO IMPORTANT. 
DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT 
FROM A POLICY SIDE?
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK IT IS A
POLICY 
QUESTION IN TERMS OF INCLUDING 
PREONS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF 
ADRD. 
THAT IS A SCIENTIFIC QUESTION 
INCLUDED TALKING RIGHT NOW TO 
FIGURE OUT IF I COULD JUST ASK 
A QUESTION ABOUT REPRESENTATION 
OF PRION. 
WE ARE NOTING IT AND WE WILL 
FOLLOW-UP. 
&gt;&gt; DOES ANYBODY ELSE WANT
TO?
&gt;&gt; THIS IS DIANE --, I
DON'T 
KNOW IF MY CAMERA IS WORKING 
HERE, BUT ANYWAYS YOU CAN HEAR 
ME.  MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE 
SHOWING ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND 
RELATED DEMENTIA. AND THE 
INFECTIONS. THERE IS A RECENT 
PAPER FROM SOME EUROPEANS AND 
SOMEONE IN THE US SHOWED THAT 
SHINGLES VACCINE CAN REDUCE THE 
INCIDENCE AT LEAST. 
AND SO I MEAN I THINK THAT 
PRION DISEASE SHOULD ALSO BE 
INCLUDED IN THIS. 
&gt;&gt; YEAH AND IF I MAY ADD--
THIS 
IS CONSTANTINO -- THE PRION 
MECHANISM HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN 
TAU PROPAGATION. 
AND SO WE WE TALK ABOUT 
SOMETHING LIKE MAD COW DISEASE, 
THE MECHANISM IS SOMETHING THAT 
NEEDS TO BE APPLIED AND IF 
THERE IS ONE CONDITION WHERE 
THIS IS GOING TO BE HIGHLY 
RELEVANT, IS MULTI ETIOLOGY 
DEMENTIA. 
IN THE CONTEXT OF VASCULAR 
INSUFFICIENCY OFTEN, THERE ARE 
CONDITIONS  THAT WILL PROMOTE 
THE PRION MECHANISM WHICH IS 
CERTAINLY HIGHLY RELEVANT TO 
THIS. ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE A PURE 
PRION DISEASE, BUT THE 
MECHANISM IS HIGHLY RELEVANT. 
WALTER CAN SAY SOMETHING ABOUT 
THAT TOO. 
&gt;&gt; YEAH.  A LITTLE BIT OF
A 
(INDISCERNIBLE) TOPIC HERE.  I 
GUESS, THERE ARE REALLY TWO 
ANSWERS TO YOUR POINT. 
THE ANSWER TO AT NINDS, PRION 
DISEASE IS REALLY IMPORTANT.  
WE ARE FUNDING RESEARCH IN 
PRION DISEASE, PUTTING 
POTENTIAL TREATMENTS FOR PRION 
DISEASE. 
WHEN FUNDING CAME FROM CONGRESS 
FOR ALZHEIMER'S AND 
ALZHEIMER'S-RELATED DEMENTIAS, 
THEY DO NOT INCLUDE ALL 
DEMENTIAS IN THE FUNDING 
APPROPRIATION. 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER 
FORMS OF DEMENTIA THAT ARE NOT 
INCLUDED IN THE FUNDING THAT IS 
PARTICULARLY COMING FROM 
CONGRESS FOR THAT PURPOSE. 
SO I GUESS THERE ARE TWO 
THINGS. ONE IS, AS COS 
MENTIONED, MECHANISM BY WHICH 
PRION SPREADS IS SO RELEVANT TO 
THE OTHER GENERATIONS THAT WERE 
LISTED. WHICH ARE LEVY BODY 
DEMENTIA, CARDIOVASCULAR 
IMPAIRMENT -- AND  
FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA.  THERE 
IT IS RELEVANT TO USE THOSE 
FUNDS.
BUT OTHERWISE WE USE REGULAR 
NINDS FUNDS FOR STUDYING PEOPLE 
WITH PRION DISEASE. I KNOW IT 
IS A TECHNICAL THING.  BUT WE 
HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE 
APPROPRIATION LANGUAGE THAT 
CONGRESS GIVES US. 
&gt;&gt; CAN I SAY-- I KNOW
WALTER- 
CAN I ASK A QUESTION YOU DON'T 
HAVE TO ANSWER THIS. 
WHATEVER CONDITIONS THAT ARE 
NOT CONGRESSIONALLY MANDATED, 
CAN THAT BE INCLUDED IN THE 
REPORT AS A REFERENCE?
FOR OTHERS. 
&gt;&gt; DR. KOROSHETZ: YEAH, 
WHATEVER YOU THINK IS IMPORTANT 
THAT IS WHAT GOES INTO THE 
REPORT.  NOT A POLITICAL 
DOCUMENT. 
&gt;&gt; GREAT.  BECAUSE AS I
WAS 
TRYING TO SAY, THIS  IS WHERE 
PRIVATE FUNDERS -- AND 
INTERNATIONAL FUNDERS WOULD 
COME IN AND PARTNER OR DO 
THINGS INTERNATIONALLY.  AND SO 
IT IS GREAT. I WANT TO HAVE 
THIS DOCUMENT BE A SHINING 
EXAMPLE ON THE HILL, WHATEVER 
YOU WANT TO CALL IT; THE 
DEFINITIVE RECOMMENDATION TO GO 
INTO THE NATIONAL PLAN. THANK 
YOU. 
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. 
LET' SEE. 
TRYING TO SEE THE NAME. I 
CANNOT SEE THE WHOLE NAME. ERIC 
-- I THINK YOU ARE NEXT. 
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU HEAR ME?
(INDISCERNIBLE). 
ALL RIGHT.  SO -- I WANTED TO 
THANK YOU ALL FOR THE GREAT 
PRESENTATIONS OVER THE PAST TWO 
DAYS.  I THINK IT IS BEEN VERY, 
VERY INFORMATIVE FOR ME. 
SO I HAVE ... THREE QUESTIONS. 
THREE POINTS I WANTED TO MAKE.
I GUESS I WOULD DO ONE AT A 
TIME.
THE FIRST ONE IS A NEURO- 
INFLAMMATION.  IF WE LOOK AT 
ALL OF THIS NEURO-GENETIC 
DISORDER, SPREADING 
PROGRESSION, INFORMATION IS 
INVOLVED IN ALL OF THEM. SEEMS 
TO BE THE DRIVER. 
IN TERMS OF PRIORITIZATION BY 
THIS COMMITTEE, HOW 
(INDISCERNIBLE) FROM THIS?
IN TERMS OF EMPHASIS ON THE 
IMPORTANCE, WHERE DO YOU RANK 
NEURO- INFLAMMATION?
EXPECTING TO SEE BIO MATICS 
(PHONETIC). 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU THAT IS A 
COST-CUTTING TOPIC. I'M 
WONDERING IF SOMEBODY FROM THE 
MED BASIC AND CLINICAL 
COMMITTEE MIGHT BE WILLING TO 
TAKE THIS QUESTION ABOUT NEURO- 
INFLAMMATION, AND HOW IT IS 
BEING CONSIDERED AND IF IT IS 
BEING GIVEN ADEQUATE PRIORITY. 
OR ANYONE ELSE. 
&gt;&gt; SO INFLAMMATION HAS
WORKED 
ITS WAY IN ALL KINDS OF ACUTE 
AND CHRONIC DISEASES, INCLUDING 
NEURO- GENETIC DISEASES. 
THERE'S A TREMENDOUS EFFORT TO 
UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF IMMUNE 
CELLS WITHIN THE BRAIN WHICH 
RECENTLY HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED 
AND THEY WERE NOT KNOWN 
PREVIOUSLY TO BE SO MUCH 
INVOLVED BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF 
PROPER MARKERS AND SO ON. 
AND SO NOW THERE IS A GREAT 
EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE 
OF MICROGLIA IN BOTH IN THE 
CONTEXT OF  VASCULAR DISEASE 
AND IN THE CONTEXT OF TAU, TDP 
43, AMYLOID AND SO ON. 
THERE IS AN EMERGING ROLE OF 
THE MILO SALES ASSOCIATE WITH 
THE BORDER OF THE BRAIN MOTOR 
ASSOCIATED MACROPHAGES, WHICH 
ARE THE CONSTANT CAUSES OF THE 
MICROGLIA INVOLVED IN AN NUMBER 
OF CRITICAL FUNCTIONS RELEVANT 
TO DEMENTIA. FOR EXAMPLE 
CLEARANCE OF AMYLOID AND TAU. 
THERE IS ALSO AN EMERGING ROLE 
OF T CELLS. BOTH THE INNATE 
KIND LIKE THE DTP 17 AND GAMMA 
DELTA T CELLS THAT PRODUCE 
TOXIC CYTOKINES WHICH ARE 
INVOLVED IN THE MECHANISMS OF 
DEMENTIA. 
SO I THE NEURO-INFLAMMATION IS 
KIND OF AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT 
OF THIS THAT CONSTITUTES THE 
DEMENTIA FIELD. PARTICULARLY 
MULTI- (INDISCERNIBLE) 
DEMENTIA, WHERE ALL THE 
PATHOGENIC FACTORS INTO 
CONVERGENT CAUSE NEURO- 
INFLAMMATION. 
&gt;&gt; I AM THINKING MORE
ALONG THE 
LINES OF IF THERE IS A 
PARTICULAR ORDER OF 
PRIORITIZATION OR RANK. IS 
THERE ANY FUNDING OR RESOURCES, 
DIRECTIONAL RESOURCES?
THAT IS WHY I AM CURIOUS. 
ANOTHER WAS A TALK, SOME ITEMS 
WERE PRIORITIZED AS 1, 2, 3...
&gt;&gt; OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD
THERE 
ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER PHASES 
FOCUSING ON THE INFORMATION IS 
ONE OF THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED 
IN BRAIN DISEASES AND SOMEONE 
FROM DNH MAY BE MORE QUALIFIED 
TO ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY THE 
FUNDS. ALLOTTED TO THAT. 
&gt;&gt; I CAN ALSO MAKE SURE WE
NOTE 
THIS. AND AS WE REVIEW THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS, WE CAN MAKE 
SURE THAT INFORMATION IS AT AN 
APPROPRIATELY HIGH-PRIORITY.
CAN YOU MOVE TO YOUR NEXT 
QUESTION BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU 
HAD THREE QUESTIONS?
&gt;&gt; YES, THE NEXT ONE,
BIOMARKER 
IMAGING. 
I KNOW CURRENTLY, 
(INDISCERNIBLE) HAVE PROVIDED 
SO MUCH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
DISEASE. 
BUT ACCESS TO PET IS DIFFICULT. 
COST. WE ALL KNOW.  IN TERMS OF 
(INDISCERNIBLE), IS THERE SOME 
PRIORITIZATION OF ALL THE 
IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES OF PET FOR 
ADRD LOOKING AT?
HOW DO THEY RANK?
HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD FOR ALL 
THE IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES OTHER 
THAN PET?
&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU TAKE THAT?
&gt;&gt; HAPPY TO TAKE THAT.
THAT IS A REALLY, REALLY GREAT 
QUESTION AND SOMETHING THAT 
WITHIN THE LEVY BODY DEMENTIA 
SESSION WE DISCUSSED IN THE 
CONTEXT OF USE AND WHY THESE 
DIFFERENT BIOMARKERS NEED TO BE 
DEVELOPED AND BALANCING BETWEEN 
THESE VERY HIGHLY DETAILED 
BIOMARKERS. 
 FOR INSTANCE THE PET IMAGING 
GIVES US THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION 
THAT COULD BE VERY IMPORTANT 
FOR MOVING CERTAIN THERAPIES-- 
LET'S SAY FROM ASSAYS TO PHASES 
-- OR FROM PHASE 1 TO 2.  TO 
GIVE YOU A SPECIALIST REGIONAL 
PROTEINS. 
ARE GOING BACK TO A PRIOR 
COMMENT WHETHER OR NOT CERTAIN 
PROTEINS IN CERTAIN REGIONS OF 
THE BRAIN DO OR DO NOT HAVE AN 
INFLUENCE ON THE CLINICAL 
PICTURE. RIGHT?
SO THAT IS WHERE THOSE CAN COME 
INTO IMPORTANCE.  THEY MAY NOT 
BE REALLY THE ONES THAT YOU 
WANT TO PUSH FORWARD ON A 
SCALABLE LEVEL FOR USE IN BROAD 
CLINICAL USE. 
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 
(AUDIO LOST)
&gt;&gt; ... COULD BE DONE AT
SCALE 
ACROSS MULTIPLE DIFFERENT 
SECTORS BOTH ACADEMIC AND NOT. 
I THINK THE KEY HERE IS FOR ALL 
THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO REALLY 
THINK ABOUT NOT JUST IMAGING, 
BUT WE NEED IMAGING OF WHAT, 
FOR WHAT AND IN WHAT CONTEXT TO 
USE. THAT IS A REALLY CRITICAL 
PART. YOU HAVE TO BALANCE THOSE 
WITH THE PRIORITIES. YOU NEED 
THEM BOTH BUT IN DIFFERENT 
SITUATIONS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. 
&gt;&gt; IF I MAY ALSO COMMENT,
YOU 
RAISE A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. 
DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU WANT TO 
MEASURE, I THINK YOU REALLY SEE 
A LOT OF PET WORK AND NOVEL 
TRACES AND MODALITIES.
SO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
QUESTION TO ADDRESS DEPENDING 
ON WHAT KIND OF QUESTION YOU 
WANT TO SORT OF ADDRESS WHETHER 
PROTEIN MEASUREMENT, OR YOUR 
INTEREST IS MORE OF 
PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT.
&gt;&gt; AND AS WE THINK ABOUT
EARLY 
DIAGNOSES, BRAIN IMAGING IS NOT 
WIDELY ACCESSIBLE ACROSS ALL OF 
THE UNITED STATES OTHER THAN IN 
MAINE. LARGE SWATHES OF RURAL 
MAINE DON'T EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO 
PET CT OR EVEN MRI. 
AND SO THAT IS WHAT WE THINK 
ABOUT RARE DANCING AND THE NEED 
TO FILTER PATIENTS WE USED TO 
THINK PURELY ON COGNITION AND 
NOW WE ARE THINKING IMAGING. 
AND HIGHLIGHT THE BLOOD-BRAIN 
BIOMARKERS WE DISCUSSED.
&gt;&gt; IF I MAY ADD THE
PROGRESS 
MADE IN BIOMARKERS HAS BEEN 
AMAZING. THERE WAS A RECENT 
STUDY FROM BRAIN 
(INDISCERNIBLE), SHOWING THAT 
THE SECURITY LEVELS OF A 
PARTICULAR FORM OF 
PHOSPHORYLATED TAU  IS AS GOOD 
AS PET PLEA DIAGNOSIS.  IS 
GOING TO BE CHEAPER AND BETTER 
FOR SCREENING, FOR LARGE, HIGH 
THROUGHPUT APPROACHES. 
AND I ESPECIALLY FOR LOCATIONS 
WHERE IMAGING IS OTHERWISE 
AVAILABLE, VERY COSTLY AND 
REQUIRE SPECIALIZED PEOPLE. 
IT WOULD BE GREAT TO ALSO CROSS 
THE BLOOD BARRIER MARKER. 
UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE VASCULAR 
COMPONENT OF DEMENTIA THERE IS 
MUCH GOING ON PROMISING. 
SOMETHING IS PROMISING BUT NOT 
AS STRONG AS IT IS FOR THE 
ALZHEIMER'S DEMENTIA ASPECTS. 
&gt;&gt; CAN I JUMP IN QUICKLY?
I APPRECIATE THE REALLY 
IMPORTANT RESEARCH AND SCALING 
THAT DR. POSTIN MADE. 
WE DON'T WANT TO BE DEPENDENT 
ON ANY IMAGING MODALITIES IN 
THE INCREDIBLY VALUABLE AND WE 
NEED TO PURSUE THAT SCIENCE FOR 
ADVANCING TO THE CLINICAL 
STATION WE WILL ALWAYS NEED FOR 
SOME CASES IN CLINICAL 
EVALUATION. IT WISHERS ABOUT 
SCALING NOT JUST DOMESTICALLY 
WHERE IMAGING IS MINIMALLY 
ACCESSIBLE AT ALL,  BUT 
GLOBALLY WILL HAVE TO INVEST ON 
THE RESEARCH TO DEVELOP 
CLINICAL MODALITY TESTING THAT 
CAN BE PROVIDED THROUGHOUT BOTH 
OF IN THE GLOBAL MORE THAN 
GLOBAL SOUTH. 
BUT AS OTHERS HAVE SAID 
HOPEFULLY ENVISION-- ULTIMATELY 
IT WILL BE SALIVA AND OTHER 
MORE READILY ACCESSIBLE AND 
ANALYZABLE FLUIDS. 
SO IT IS A CONTINUUM.  WE ARE 
NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO JUST 
SKIP ANYTHING. BUT WHERE WE ARE 
IN BALANCE PUT OUR FOCUS FOR 
CLINICAL APPLICATION IN THE 
GLOBAL CONTEXT, 90% OF THE 
CASES OF COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT 
ARE NOT IN ADVANCED, WESTERN 
ECONOMIES. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE 
TO GET THOSE OTHER MODALITIES 
OF PROTECTION AND DIAGNOSIS, 
BOTH CLINICAL OBSERVATION BUT 
IN A MORE SENSITIVE AND 
SPECIFIC WAY. BUT ALSO FLUID 
SAMPLES THAT ARE EASILY 
ANALYZED WITH AGAIN HIGH 
SPECIFICITY AND SENSITIVITY. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; MY FINAL CONTRIBUTION, 
QUESTION OR COMMENT. SLEEP 
DEFICIT AND OLFACTORY DEFICITS. 
CURRENTLY MY UNDERSTANDING IS 
THAT, FOR A PATIENT TO BE 
REFERRED TO RECEIVE A PET SCAN 
FOR AMYLOID THEY MUST HAVE GONE 
THROUGH AN ELEMENTAL EXAM. 
PROBABLY (INDISCERNIBLE) WHEN 
THE PATIENT IS REFERRED TO GET 
A PET SCAN. 
IS THAT CORRECT?
IT IS ALSO NOW COMMON IN THIS 
SMALL ANIMAL MODELS, THAT SLEEP 
DEFICIT AND OLFACTORY DEFICIT 
... THEY MAY COME REALLY EARLY 
WHEN THE DISEASE IS IN THE 
EARLY STAGES BEFORE IT GETS 
INTO THE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. 
AND THERE ARE BIG 
CONSIDERATIONS IN THIS 
COMMITTEE, THINKING ABOUT MAYBE 
RANKING, PUTTING THE SLEEP 
DISORDERS COMMITTEE, OLFACTORY 
DEFICITS AS APPOINTED WE SHOULD 
RAISE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO GET 
A PET SCAN. ACCOMPANIED BY THE 
(INDISCERNIBLE) BIOMARKERS, AND 
WE HAVE A COMBINATION OF 
(INDISCERNIBLE) BIOMARKERS IN 
ANY OF THESE DEFICITS. 
IS THERE A POINT WHERE YOU 
START THINKING ABOUT A PET SCAN?
&gt;&gt; ALICE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU
MIGHT HAVE A THOUGHT. 
&gt;&gt; I WANTED TO ADDRESS
WHAT IAN 
SAID PREVIOUS TO THIS ALSO WHAT 
ERIC SAID RIGHT NOW. 
AND SO TO THE FIRST COMMENT, I 
THINK THAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER 
THAT AT THIS MOMENT FOR THESE 
DISORDERS WE HAVE MINIMAL 
DISEASE MODIFYING THERAPIES. SO 
WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO RIGHT 
NOW IS NOT ONLY KIND OF DEVELOP 
DIAGNOSTICS BUT ALSO TRYING TO 
ENABLE TRIALS THAT WOULD THEN 
ENABLE DISEASE MODIFYING 
THERAPIES TO BE DEVELOPED. 
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE HISTORY 
OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, WITHOUT 
THE BASIC AMYLOID DIES, JOE 
STRAUSS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO GO THE WAY THEY DID. I 
AM NOT ORDERING AMYLOID STAINS 
ON MY PATIENTS AND SO THERE ARE 
THINGS THAT ENABLE TRIALS SO WE 
CAN DEVELOP THERAPIES AND WE 
HAVE TO WORK ON THOSE. BECAUSE 
WE DON'T HAVE THERAPIES AND AT 
THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO THINK 
ABOUT HOW WE TRANSLATE THESE 
BIOMARKERS IN ALZHEIMER'S, FOR 
THE CSF, TAU AND AB MARKERS.  
THAT GIVES US A LITTLE 
BLUEPRINT FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH 
OTHER DISEASES. 
AND WITH RESPECT TO ERIC'S 
QUESTION, THIS IS THE MOST 
RELEVANT, OLFACTORY AND SLEEP 
DEFICIT FOR THE BODY DISORDERS. 
YOU BOTH HYPOSMIA ARE AT 
INCREASED RISK FOR LEVY BODY 
DEMENTIA DISORDERS AND PEOPLE 
WITH (INDISCERNIBLE) AND I 
WOULD SAY THAT I KNOW THAT WHEN 
DR. TOLEDO  SPELL BEFORE HE 
TALKED ABOUT THE COHORT, THERE 
IS THAT COHORT OF PEOPLE WITH 
SLEEP DISORDERS. AND MANY OF 
THE OTHER COHORTS WE TALK 
ABOUT, PPMI COHORT AND 
PARKINSON'S PROGRESSION MARKER 
INITIATIVE COHORT, THEY 
INCORPORATE HYPOSMIA, OLFACTORY 
TESTING. 
I WANTED TO REASSURE YOU, THAT 
IS NOT BEING MISSED RIGHT NOW. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH ERIC
FOR 
THOSE POINTS. 
I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO 
DALE DINA (PHONETIC). 
WE CAN HEAR YOU JUST YET. 
&gt;&gt; GIVE IT A TRY AGAIN
WITH 
STAR SIX. 
&gt;&gt; HOW IS THAT?
&gt;&gt; PERFECT WE CAN HEAR
YOU. 
&gt;&gt; GOOD. FIRST I WANT TO
HAND 
OUT A BEAUTIFUL BOUQUET OF 
FLOWERS TO EACH OF YOU. FROM 
WAY... I HAVE BEEN 
PARTICIPATING IN THESE PROGRAMS 
NOW FIVE OR SIX YEARS AND I 
WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT AND THE 
EVOLUTION OF THESE SESSIONS HAS 
BEEN SPECTACULAR.
ONE OF THE FIRST SESSIONS AND 
SO FORTH WAS DIFFICULTY FROM 
UNIVERSITY RESEARCH TO ANOTHER 
UNIVERSITY RESEARCH, THE 
VERNACULAR WAS FOR THE SAME 
THING VERY DIFFERENT. 
AND SO THE DIFFICULTY REALLY 
UNDERSTANDING ONE ANOTHER, LET 
ALONE A GUY LIKE ME OFF THE 
STREET. 
EARLY ON THIS IS A COMMITTEE TO 
STANDARDIZE THE VERNACULAR. AND 
THAT HAS BEEN DONE AND WE DON'T 
EVEN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT 
ANYMORE. OR EARLY START IS WHAT 
IT APPEARS LIKE TO ME. 
ALSO THE PROCEDURE OF SETTING 
UP GOALS AND STUFF FOR 
ACCOMPLISHING THOSE GOALS AND 
SO FORTH, THAT WAS AN EVOLUTION 
FROM WAY BACK THEN. JUSTICE 
PARTICULAR PROCESS AND LOOK AT 
IT NOW EACH OF YOU HAS AT ANY 
TO STANDARDIZE AND IN A WAY 
THAT I IS A SPECTACULAR.
NOW BACK IN 2000 WE HAD A GOAL. 
NIH SAID THAT WITHIN FIVE YEARS 
WE WOULD HAVE CURED ONE OF THE 
DEMENTIAS. WELL WE HAVEN'T, BUT 
WE ARE WORKING ON IT. 
THE FIRST PART OF MY QUESTION 
IS,  WHICH ONE OF THE DEMENTIAS 
IS THE BEST CANDIDATE IN YOUR 
VIEW?
MY FIRST QUESTION.
&gt;&gt; I LOVE THAT QUESTION. 
WHO 
WANTS TO TAKE IT?
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S...IT MIGHT
NOT BE 
ANSWERABLE. 
&gt;&gt; NOT SURE HE IS HERE, HE
MIGHT HAVE A GOOD ANSWER BUT 
WHO CAN SPEAK TO THIS IMPORTANT 
QUESTION?
&gt;&gt; CONSTANTINO MIGHT. I
SEE HIM 
SMILING AND SHAKING HIS HEAD. 
&gt;&gt; EVERYONE ON THE CALL
WANTS 
TO ANSWER. 
GREAT PINT. 
&gt;&gt; DR. IADECOLA: WE CAN
GIVE 
YOU OUR TAKE OUR PERSONAL...
&gt;&gt; I AM INTERESTED IN
YOURS. 
&gt;&gt; DR. IADECOLA: I THINK
THE 
MAJOR ADVANCE THAT YOU HAVE 
SEEN TODAY, AND WE HOPE THAT 
THIS IS GOING GO BACK TO THE 
OVERALL MEDICAL COMMUNITY WHICH 
IS NOT THE CASE IS THAT 
DEMENTIA OF AGE IS NOT REALLY 
ONE DISEASE. 
SO IF WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE 
GENERAL PRACTITIONERS AND 
NEUROLOGISTS AND EVERYBODY ELSE 
TO UNDERSTAND THAT, THAT WILL 
BE A GREAT SUCCESS. 
BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW TO PREVENT 
AND PARTIALLY TREAT SOME 
ASPECTS OF THIS DEMENTIA 
PROCESS. 
FOR EXAMPLE THE  VASCULAR 
PROCESS.  WE HAVE MADE 
TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN 
TREATING, AND PREVENTING 
STROKES FOR EXAMPLE. THE 
MORTALITY FOR STROKE SINCE THE 
1960S IS REDUCED BY 60%. 
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO DEMENTIA, 
IT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE 
COMPLICATED. WHY?
BECAUSE THERE ARE MULTIPLE 
THINGS GOING ON. AND SO I THINK 
IT IS NOT GOOD TO BE A SILVER 
BULLET THAT EVERYBODY LIKES. 
ALL RIGHT?
IF YOU WANT TO PUBLISH IN 
NATURE, YOU HAVE TO PROPOSED A 
SINGLE BULLET. BUT LIFE DOES 
NOT WORK LET WAY. 
I THINK THAT IT IS GOING TO BE 
A COMBINATION OF PREVENTION, 
VASO PROTECTIVE APPROACHES LIKE 
STATINS AND GOP'S WHATEVER YOU 
WANT. MAYBE AMYLOID IN ONE 
CASE, TAU AND OTHERS. AND THAT 
IS WHY WE ARE STRUGGLING SO 
MUCH WITH THESE BIOMARKERS. 
WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE HOW TO 
DECREASE AMYLOID LEVELS NOT 
SPECTACULAR. WHY?
BECAUSE OF THE FIVE OR SIX 
THINGS GOING ON THAT WE ARE NOT 
ABLE TO ADDRESS SO MY ANSWER IS 
A COMBINATION APPROACH, AND 
PREVENTION BEING ONE OF THEM. 
AND VASO PROTECTION IS ONE OF 
THE MAJOR FEATURES. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
CONSTANTINO.  THAT IS EASY FOR 
ME TO FOLLOW. AND THE 
VERNACULAR FOR ME, FOR EACH 
INDIVIDUAL, FOR ALL THE 
DIFFERENT VARIETIES AND SO 
FORTH AND DIFFERENT MIXES OF 
THOSE VARIETIES ALMOST HAVE TO 
WHIP UP A COCKTAIL FOR EACH ONE 
OF PEOPLE THAT HAS A PROBLEM. 
BALANCING IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT 
WILL TREAT EACH ONE OF THOSE 
PIECES.  I KNOW THAT IS A BIG, 
TALL ORDER. 
I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE WORKING ON 
IT. AND IS ONE MEMBER OF THE 
PUBLIC ARE JUST WANT TO SAY 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
BACK WHEN WE STARTED, WE HAD 
THE TECHNOLOGICAL PEOPLE 
TALKING, ONCE THEY GOT THE 
NOMENCLATURE STANDARDIZED. 
BUT THERE WAS LITTLE MENTION OF 
THE CAREGIVER. AND THE 
TECHNOLOGICAL DISCUSSION AND SO 
FORTH WAS AMONGST THE 
RESEARCHERS WHO DO THAT WORK.  
AND, YOU'VE GOT A WAY  OF 
COMMUNICATING WITH ONE ANOTHER. 
LATIN, GREEK AND SO FORTH. THE 
COMMON GUY OFF THE STREET DOES 
NOT UNDERSTAND. 
YOU HAVE TRIED TO...I REALLY 
APPRECIATE YOU HAVE MADE THE 
EFFORT IN A VERY GOOD ONE TO 
RESOLVE THAT SO GUYS LIKE ME 
CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS. WE 
ARE ALL SPEAKING ENGLISH BUT 
THEN THERE'S ALL DIFFERENT 
KINDS OF ENGLISH. 
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A QUESTION 
ON THE NEURON WALL.  I JUST 
LEARNED FROM MY PREVIOUS 
QUESTION THAT TAU MIGHT MIGRATE 
SOMEWHERE IN AND OUT OF THE 
NEURON.
HOW DOES IT DO THAT?
IS THE NEURON WALL SEMI 
PERMEABLE?
&gt;&gt; WHO WOULD LIKE TO TAKE?
&gt;&gt; I CAN TAKE IT IF YOU
WANT. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU THAT WILL BE 
WONDERFUL. 
&gt;&gt; SO THERE ARE MANY
MECHANISMS 
BY WHICH TAU CAN MIGRATE FROM 
ONE CELL TO THE OTHER.  SOME OF 
THEM INVOLVE FORMING LITTLE 
VESICLES IN THE CELL MEMBRANE 
AND THESE LITTLE VESICLES THEY 
PUT TAU OUTSIDE OF THE CELL 
MEMBRANE. AND THE NEXT CELL 
PICKED IT UP IN A LITTLE 
VESICLE AND INCLUDED IN ITSELF.
THERE ARE ALSO RECEPTORS IN THE 
NEURAL MECHANISM. THERE ARE 
SOME RECEPTORS THAT CAN 
RECOGNIZE TAU, USUALLY NOT 
SPECIFICALLY TAU BUT THEY CAN 
RECOGNIZE TAU AND BRING IT INTO 
THE OTHER CELL. 
SO THERE ARE MANY MECHANISMS 
THAT COORDINATE THIS 
TRANSMISSION AND IS INTERESTING 
BECAUSE NOW WE SEE THAT TAU IS 
ALSO NOT JUST INSIDE THE NEURON 
BUT ALSO OUTSIDE THE 
VASCULATURE, LIKE IN THE 
ENDOTHELIAL CELLS. SO THERE'S A 
LOT OF PROGRESS IN THAT FIELD 
RIGHT NOW. 
&gt;&gt; SO YOU THINK ABOUT IT
LIKE 
FOOTBALL, THEY CAN PICK TAU, 
ENDED HAND IT OFF WANT TO 
ANOTHER IN A WAY. 
&gt;&gt; THAT IS HOW TAU IS
SPREAD IN 
THE BRAIN FROM ONE AREA TO THE 
OTHER. 
&gt;&gt; MY LAST COMMENT. 
YOU FOLKS ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR 
WITH THE KIPLINGER LETTER WHICH 
COMES TO YOUR MAIL BOX EVERY 
WEEK.
THIS WEEK IT SAYS AI HAS 
UNCOVERED 200 MILLION PROTEIN 
STRUCTURES, FAR MORE THAN THE 
200,000 THAT WERE KNOWN IN THE 
YEAR 2020. RESEARCHERS AT 
STANFORD HAVE CREATED A VIRTUAL 
LAB WITH AI MODELS TRAINED ON 
SPECIFIC MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE TO 
COORDINATE NEW DRUGS. 
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT 
THAT?
IS THIS A COMMON KIND OF THING 
OF USING AI?
IS IT DEPENDABLE ENOUGH FOR YOU 
TO WORK WITH?
BECAUSE I KNOW IT CAN GIVE YOU 
MISLEADING ANSWERS. 
IS A TOOL THAT YOU ARE USING?
I GUESS THAT IS THE QUESTION. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.  I THINK
THIS IS 
A CROSSCUTTING THEME. I MANY OF 
US ACROSS ALL OF THE COMMITTEES 
ARE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO USE 
AI TO ADVANCE OUR SCIENTIFIC 
WORK.  AND SO WE ARE GOING TO 
NOTE THIS AND DISCUSS THIS WHEN 
WE COME TOGETHER. 
&gt;&gt; OKAY. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU AND GOING TO
TRY 
TO MOVE ON BECAUSE WE HAVE A 
FEW OTHER HANDS RAISED IN ONLY 
FIVE MORE MINUTES LEFT FOR THE 
DISCUSSION. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THOSE 
POINTS. 
I'M GOING TO GO TO STEPHEN -- 
WHO IS THE NEXT PERSON. 
&gt;&gt; THANKS CAN YOU HEAR ME
ALL 
RIGHT?
YESTERDAY I ASKED THE QUESTION 
ABOUT DRUG DELIVERY TO THE 
BRAIN WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE A 
MAJOR BARRIER TO TREATING ALL 
OF THE DEMENTIAS TALK ABOUT 
TODAY AND YESTERDAY AND I GOT 
AN ANSWER ABOUT ENDOTHELIAL 
CELLS, ETC., BEING INCLUDED  IN 
SOME OF THESE STUDIES AS A 
POTENTIAL DRIVER FOR THE 
DISEASE AND THOSE EXPERIMENTERS 
ARE DISTINCT FROM THOSE THAT 
REVEAL HOW TRANSPORT WORKS 
ACROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER 
IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS, 
INCLUDING A HEALTHY CONTEXT. 
PREVENTING DEMENTIA AND HOW TO 
POTENTIALLY LEVERAGE THAT FOR 
DRUG DELIVERY WHICH MAY HAVE A 
LARGE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO 
TREAT ALL OF THE DISEASES. 
WHY DON'T THE RECOMMENDATIONS 
MENTIONED EXPLICITLY THIS 
EFFORT TO DEVELOP DRUGS THAT 
CROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER 
MORE EFFICIENTLY AND 
SELECTIVELY?
&gt;&gt; WHO CAN TAKE THAT?
&gt;&gt; I CAN TRY. 
I MEAN IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT 
QUESTION.  AND A VERY IMPORTANT 
ISSUE FOR THE FIELD. 
FOR PART OF THIS IN ALZHEIMER'S 
AND OTHER DEMENTIAS IS MADE A 
LITTLE BIT EASIER BY THE FACT 
THAT THE BLOOD BARRIER BRAIN IS 
ALREADY LEAKING IN SOME OF 
THESE CASES.  SOME OF THE DRUGS 
CAN PASS A LITTLE BIT BETTER 
BECAUSE OF THAT, BUT STILL I IT 
HAS TO BE A QUESTION THAT IS ON 
THE SPECIFIC CLINICAL TRIAL. 
AND THE SPECIFIC PRECLINICAL 
STUDY ON THAT SPECIFIC DRUG. 
OF COURSE THIS DRUG WILL ONLY 
WORK IF IT IS A DRUG THAT 
TARGETS NEURONS, IF IT IS ABLE 
TO PASS THE BLOOD BRAIN 
BARRIER. AND SO AT THE 
TRANSLATIONAL LEVEL, WE HAVE TO 
BE ABLE TO CREATE DRUGS-- THE 
SPECIFIC DRUG THAT YOU WANT TO 
ANALYZE TO MAKE IT A MOLECULE 
THAT IS ABLE TO PASS THE BLOOD 
BRAIN BARRIER. AND ONLY IF IT 
CAN DO THAT, THEN WE CAN MOVE 
TO THE CLINICAL LEVEL AND STUDY 
IT IN HUMANS. 
AND SO I THINK THE NIH IS 
CREATING SYSTEMS LIKE THAT AND 
MAYBE WALTER WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
IT.  BUT THEY ARE KIND OF LIKE 
MEDIATED BY STEPS. 
AND WE CAN DO A PRECLINICAL 
STEP WHEN WE MAKE SURE THE DRUG 
WILL PASS THE BLOOD BRAIN 
BARRIER AND THEN WE CAN MOVE ON 
TO THE CLINICAL STEP. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THAT
ANSWER. 
GO AHEAD, PLEASE. 
&gt;&gt; IF I MAY, THERE IS
ALREADY A 
LOT OF INTEREST IN DEVELOPING 
(INDISCERNIBLE). FOR EXAMPLE 
ROCHE HAS A TRIAL SHOWN TO 
REDUCE THE AMYLOID YOU HAVE TO 
HAVE A GOOD DRUG FIRST, AND 
THEN YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT FOR 
EXAMPLE THE BRAIN SHUTTLE USES 
A TRANSFERENCE REFLECTOR HIGHLY 
BROUGHT INTO THE BRAIN. AND 
THINGS ARE ALREADY ONGOING AND 
WE NEED THE DRUG AND THEN WILL 
BE READY TO GO.
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO ADD TO THE
POINT. 
THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORTS GOING 
UNNECESSARY LISTED AS ADRD OR 
IRRELEVANT TO ADRD, MECHANISMS 
DELIVER THINGS TO DIFFERENT 
TISSUES, SPECIFICITY AND THE 
BRAIN IS INCLUDED IN SOME OF 
THOSE CONSORTIUMS. MAY BE ABLE 
WHOSE IS TO INCLUDE IT IN THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS TO LOOK 
OUTWARDS ABOUT HOW THESE DRUGS, 
THOSE TYPES OF DRUG DELIVERY 
MECHANISMS-- WE DON'T WANT TO 
BE REINVENTING ANYTHING. 
&gt;&gt; THANKS. THAT MAKES A
LOT OF 
SENSE AND I WILL GENTLY SUGGEST 
THAT TRANSFERRING RECEPTORS ARE 
IMPERFECT AND THE EFFICIENCIES 
WILL BE LOW AND DRUGS ARE 
GETTING TO OTHER ORGANS AND I 
WOULD ALSO SAY THAT I WILL BE 
INTERESTED IN FINDING SOMETHING 
BETTER THAN TRANSFERRING 
RECEPTOR  OR ANTIBODY TARGETING 
IT BEFORE KNOWING WHICH DRUG 
WAS GOING TO DELIVER. MIGHT 
EVEN SUGGEST THE DRUGS 
TARGETING ANY OF THESE 
DEMENTIAS CAN BE APPENDED TO 
SUCH A SHUTTLE SO IT CAN BE A 
GENERAL WITH BROADER CAPABILITY 
TO ALL OF THESE IMAGES. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THAT. 
&gt;&gt; ONE MORE THING
IMPORTANT THE 
PERIPHERAL IMMUNE CELLS 
MENTIONED IN MANY OF THESE 
DEMENTIAS, CELLS ARE MAKING IT 
INTO THE BRAIN FROM THE BLOOD 
SYSTEM FROM THE BONE MARROW, 
SOME ENABLING THOSE CELLS IN 
ORDER TO PRODUCE WHATEVER MIGHT 
BE HELPFUL IS ALSO AN AREA THAT 
IS HUGELY UNDERSTUDIED. IT WE 
CAN LEVERAGE WHAT IS ALREADY 
HAPPENING IN THE DISEASE 
THROUGH IPS TECHNOLOGIES AND 
GENETICS, THAT IS A HUGE AREA 
THAT NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT. 
&gt;&gt; SO WE HAVE JUST A
COUPLE OF 
MINUTES. I WOULD LOVE IT IF WE 
COULD HEAR FROM HOLLAND MESKER 
(PHONETIC) AND JULIE SCHNEIDER 
TO CLOSE IS OUT OF THE PUBLIC 
COMMENT. 
SESSION GO AHEAD PLEASE HELEN. 
&gt;&gt; I WILL KEEP IT BRIEF
AND 
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS I 
WANTED TO GIVE. BUT THAT CAN 
WAIT. 
WE LOOK AT A VARIETY OF 
DISEASES TO DATE AND PUSHING 
FORWARD PARTICULARLY IN LEVY 
BODY'S REALM, WE ARE LOOKING AT 
GENETIC CODES AND LOOKING AT 
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY THE HIGH 
PENETRANCE MUTATIONS, VERSUS 
ALSO BEING INCLUSIVE OF THOSE 
VARIANCE WE KNOW OUR 
CONTRIBUTORY. 
AND SO I AM WONDERING WHY WE 
DON'T LOOK TO ACCELERATE THE 
SCIENCES ACROSS A BROADER 
SPECTRUM AND ENGAGE A LARGER 
COHORT. WHY WE AREN'T DOING 
CONCURRENT STUDIES IN 
WELL-KNOWN CONTRIBUTORY 
VARIANTS. 
&gt;&gt; I OPEN IT UP TO MY 
COLLEAGUES TO ANSWER. 
&gt;&gt; I THAT IS STARTING TO 
HAPPEN, YOU KNOW?
I YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IN 
THESE DISEASES BASICALLY THE 
TARGETED ELEMENT WAS BASED ON 
THE SIGNATURE NEUROPATHOLOGIES 
AND THE HIGH PENETRANCE GENETIC 
MUTATIONS. BUT WE ARE SEEING 
THAT THEY ARE BEING 
FUNCTIONALIZED, MEANING THAT IS 
ONE OF THE -- CERTAINLY THE 
LBD-- ONE OF THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS WAS TO 
FUNCTIONALIZED THESE GENETIC 
VARIANTS. THE THOUGHT IS WE 
SHOULD BE KIND OF LIKE USING 
THAT DATA TO IDENTIFY MORE 
TARGETS. RIGHT?
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; JULIE, COULD YOU OFFER
SOME 
CLOSING COMMENTS?
&gt;&gt; I ACTUALLY HAD A THANK
YOU. 
WONDERFUL TO HEAR EVERYBODY, 
ALL THE DISCUSSION. 
MINE WAS KIND OF QUICK. MY 
COMMENT IN QUESTION WAS FOR THE 
LEVY BODY GROUP, DISCUSSED THAT 
LEVY BODIES ARE COMMON OF MIXED 
PATHOLOGY EXHIBITING SPECIFIC 
CLINICAL SYMPTOMS BUT IN MY 
VIEW AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR 
THEIR THOUGHTS, WHY NOT OPEN IT 
UP?
WE KNOW THAT IN THE GENERAL 
POPULATION 15-20% OF PEOPLE 
HAVE LEVY BODIES OR MORE. AND 
MAY HAVE HALLUCINATION, 
FLUCTUATIONS, ETC. 
IT IS A PROBLEM AND I DON'T 
KNOW IF IT WAS EXACTLY BEING 
ADDRESSED. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
THAT 
COMMENT JULIE, SO WE ARE 
SPECIFICALLY USING LANGUAGE 
THAT TALK ABOUT INDIVIDUALS 
FROM THE PRESENT THEMATIC, 
NONSPECIFIC SYMPTOMATIC, 
CLASSICS AND THEMATIC ALL THE 
WAY THROUGH AUTOPSY IN ORDER TO 
ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. 
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF 
INDIVIDUALS WILL DEVELOP A LEVY 
BODY TYPE OF SYNDROME GO 
THROUGH A VERY NONSPECIFIC TIME 
FROM WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE 
THOSE CLASSIC SYMPTOMS. WE ALSO 
KNOW THERE ARE OTHERS WHO NEVER 
DEVELOPED THE CLASSIC LEVY BODY 
SYMPTOMS THAT MAY HAVE 
IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
THEIR LEVY BODY PATHOLOGY AND 
THAT WAS BAKED INTO THE COHORTS 
RECOMMENDATIONS AS WELL AS INTO 
THE BIOMARKERS PIECE OF IT. AND 
ALSO ON THE PATHOLOGY SIDE OF 
THINGS IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT 
HARMONIZATION ACROSS MULTIPLE 
DIFFERENT COHORT TO MAKE SURE 
LEVY BODIES ARE BEING LOOKED AT 
IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY REGARDLESS 
OF HOW SOMEBODY WAS RECRUITED 
INTO THAT PATHOLOGICAL STUDY. 
SUPER IMPORTANT IMPORTANT THANK 
YOU SO MUCH FOR MENTIONING IT. 
AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT OUR 
REVISED RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE 
THAT. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
&gt;&gt; THIS CONCLUDES OUR OPEN
INPUT PERIOD. 
I WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU 
CAN STILL PROVIDE YOUR WRITTEN 
FEEDBACK TODAY, AND JOIN US 
ALSO ON JUNE 2, WHERE WE WILL 
HAVE MORE PERIODS FOR YOUR 
INPUT. 
I WOULD LIKE FOR OUR 
CONTRACTORS TO SHARE MY SLIDES, 
AS I WILL DO MY BEST TO 
SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE REALLY 
IMPORTANT INPUT THAT WE HAVE. 
GATHERED DURING THESE TWO DAYS 
AND WE WILL USED TO REVISE THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
&gt;&gt; DR. POSSIN: SO I WANT
TO 
START BY SAYING THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR PARTICIPATION AND INPUT. 
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE 
THOUGHT ABOUT OVER THE LAST 
COUPLE OF DAYS HAVE BEEN 
DRAFTED BY NINE COMMITTEES WITH 
135 MANY MEMBERS, MOST OF WHOM 
ARE SCIENTISTS, BUT ALSO PEOPLE 
WOULD LIVED EXPERIENCE AND 
PEOPLE WHO WORK IN GOVERNMENT 
AND POLICY. 
I AM SO GRATEFUL TO OUR 
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO WERE 
FLEXIBLE AND GENEROUS WITH OUR 
MOVE FROM THE IN PERSON MEETING 
IN MARCH TO THIS VIRTUAL 
MEETING AND THE CHANGE OF DATE. 
ESPECIALLY DURING THE TIME THAT 
HAS BEEN OFTEN CHALLENGING FOR 
SCIENTISTS. SO THANK YOU FOR 
THE AMENDMENT TO THIS PROCESS. 
IT HAS BEEN INSPIRING AND WE 
HAVE 2100 PEOPLE REGISTER FOR 
THE MEETING AS OF THIS MORNING 
AND THERE MAY BE MORE AND 
ACROSS THE TEAMS MEETING IN 
VIDEOCAST WE HAD UP TO 1000 
PEOPLE ADDING ONE TIME, SO 
RECORD ENGAGEMENT.
WE HAD EIGHT LIVE PUBLIC INPUT 
SESSIONS WITH MORE TO COME AND 
SOME WONDERFUL AND INSIGHTFUL 
EMAIL FEEDBACK. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
I WILL REVIEW SOME OF THE 
OVERARCHING THEMES THAT I HEARD 
AT THE SUMMIT. 
THE FIRST IS THAT THERE HAS 
BEEN AN INCREDIBLE PROGRESS IN 
THE ADRD RESEARCH FIELD EVEN 
JUST SINCE THE 2022 SUMMIT AND 
YET THERE IS AN URGENCY TO KEEP 
MOVING FORWARD. 
THERE IS AN APPRECIATION 
EXPRESS FOR NIH'S INVESTMENT IN 
THE SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS; THE 
MASSIVE REPORT WE HEARD THIS 
MORNING HIGHLIGHTED THE 
SIGNIFICANT CONTINUED 
INVESTMENT IN PRIORITY RESEARCH 
AND IT MUST CONTINUE. 
AND WE HEARD THAT WHEN CHOOSING 
RESEARCH PRIORITIES, PLEASE 
KEEP THE PATIENTS AND FAMILIES 
OF THE TOP OF MIND. WE HEARD 
THAT FROM SOMEBODY FROM LIVED 
EXPENSES. 
DEMENTIA IS NOT POLITICAL. IT 
AFFECTS ALL OF US IT IS A 
BIPARTISAN ISSUE. 
RACE COMPLEXITY WAS ANOTHER 
THING. WE KNOW ANYTHING DISCUSS 
THE DIAGNOSIS OF ADRD IS NOT A 
YES/NO SITUATION. IT IS CAUSED 
BY MULTIFACETED INTERPLAY OF 
BIOLOGIC, GENETIC, 
ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL BEHAVIOR 
ELEMENTS AND  TO UNDERSTAND 
THESE DISEASES WELL WE NEED TO 
INTEGRATE DATA SOURCES, 
PERSPECTIVES AND METHODS.
MOST PATIENTS HAVE MIXED 
ETIOLOGIES CALCIUM THEIR 
DEMENTIA AND THE PATHOLOGICAL 
OVERLAP IN THE DISEASES THAT WE 
STUDIED. 
I REALLY ENJOYED THE DISCUSSION 
ABOUT HOW POST-TDI IS TRULY AN 
MED. 
WE HAVE TO RAISE THIS 
COMPLEXITY AND THERE WERE 
COMMENTS MADE ABOUT IMPROVING 
MED CODING IN THE ELECTRONIC 
HEALTH RECORDS TO IMPROVE CARE 
AND IMPROVE DATA HARMONIZATION 
OPPORTUNITIES.  AND ALSO 
ADVANCING AND APPLYING 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHODS 
TO UNDERSTAND AND ACCOMMODATE 
FOR THE COMPLEXITY THAT WE ARE 
STUDYING. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
THEME 3, COLLABORATIVE 
APPROACHES ARE NEEDED AT 
MULTIPLE LEVELS. 
ACROSS EVERY SESSION IT WAS 
MENTIONED THAT WE NEED TO KEEP 
IMPROVING OUR APPROACHES FOR 
HARMONIZATION, AND MOVING 
TOWARDS BROAD DATA SHARING.
WE NEED EXTENSIVE BIOMARKERS 
THAT CAN BE WIDELY COLLECTED IN 
STANDARD WAYS. WE NEED TO 
LEVERAGE PRIVATE/ PUBLIC 
PARTNERSHIPS IN DATA 
REPOSITORIES AND WE NEED COMMON 
DEFINITIONS AND NOMENCLATURE TO 
SUPPORT DATA HARMONIZATION FOR 
EXAMPLE AROUND FTLD DIAGNOSIS. 
WE NEED TO ENGAGE A VARIETY OF 
STAKEHOLDERS IN ALL STEPS OF 
RESEARCH, INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH 
LIVED EXPERIENCE.
WE WANT TO CONTINUE OUR 
PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS FEDERAL 
AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN CRUCIAL 
FOR THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE 
SEEN DURING THIS SUMMIT. 
AND PRIVATE/ PUBLIC 
PARTNERSHIPS AND CRUCIAL AS 
WELL FOR ADVANCING TIMES AND WE 
HEARD THAT NIH SUPPORT IS 
CRITICAL FOR THESE PARTNERSHIPS 
TO CONTINUE ESPECIALLY IN AN 
FTD AREA THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN 
MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TO 
TACKLE THESE COMBOS PROBLEMS 
HIGHLIGHTED BY NASEM AND ALSO 
NEED COLLABORATION IN OUR CARE 
PATHWAYS AND AS WE TRY TO 
IMPROVE ACCESS TO CARE. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
BIOMARKERS!
WE MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS IN THE 
LAST THREE YEARS AND MORE, BUT 
THERE IS SO MUCH MORE PROGRESS 
THAT IS NEEDED BECAUSE THE 
AIKIDO DISENTANGLING CLINICAL, 
PATHOLOGICAL, HETEROGENEITY AND 
NAD. 
WE NEED THEM FOR DIAGNOSIS FOR 
EXAMPLE WE HEARD HOW LATE IS 
ONLY DIAGNOSED AT AUTOPSY AND 
WE NEED BETTER BIOMARKERS FOR 
MED, POST-TBI, WHERE WE CAN SEE 
SO MANY DIFFERENT ETIOLOGIES 
PRESENT IN THE PATIENTS. TDP-43 
BIOMARKER IS PARTICULARLY 
NEEDED. AND AS POINTED OUT BY 
KAREN AND LARRY, HAVING 
RELIABLE BIOMARKERS IS CRITICAL 
AN AUTOPSY IS TOO LATE. WE 
CANNOT JUST HAVE BIOMARKERS FOR 
AD. 
IT IS CRITICAL FOR MONITORING 
ESPECIALLY FOR MONITORING 
AGENTS AND ACCESS TO BIOMARKERS 
AS PART OF THE SCALABLE, 
DIAGNOSTIC PATHWAYS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
I THINK THIS IS MY LAST 
OVERARCHING THEME. FOSTERING 
INCLUSIVE RESEARCH AND ACCESS 
TO CARE. WE NEED TO STUDY THE 
POPULATIONS MOST AT RISK. IT 
WAS SUGGESTED THAT RIGOROUS 
SCIENCE REQUIRES ADDRESSING 
HEALTH EQUITY AND WE SHOULD 
THINK ABOUT USING THE RIGHT, 
CLEAR, DECISIVE LANGUAGE ON 
THIS IN ADVANCE RESEARCH THAT 
WILL HELP THE MOST VULNERABLE 
AND UNDERSERVED PATIENTS IT IS 
SO IMPORTANT AND WE NEED 
GENOMIC DATA THAT IS 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE US 
POPULATION. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO I HAVE TAKEN CAREFUL NOTE OF 
THE INPUT WE RECEIVED IN THESE 
SESSIONS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A 
PART OF.  AND ALSO THE WRITTEN 
FEEDBACK THAT I RECEIVED FROM 
YESTERDAY. HAVE NOT GOTTEN 
THROUGH THE WRITTEN FEEDBACK WE 
GOT TODAY, BUT I'M VERY EXCITED 
TO DO SO AND I AM SUMMARIZING 
THOSE IN THE SESSION AND I WILL 
HIGHLIGHT A FEW THINGS. 
IN THE FIRST SESSION WHICH WAS 
ON RESEARCH AND IMPLEMENTATION 
OF DISCOVERIES INTO PRACTICE, 
THERE WAS FEEDBACK THAT THAT 
WHEN LOOKING AT DIAGNOSIS IN 
PRIMARY CARE NEED TO MAKE SURE 
THAT LESS TYPICAL SYMPTOMS ARE 
NOT MISSED. 
WE NEED TO NORMALIZE BRAIN 
HEALTH EVALUATIONS. 
AND WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE 
RESEARCH ON CULTURALLY 
COMPETENT COMMUNICATION OF 
BRAIN HEALTH INFORMATION. 
CARE APPROACHES NEED TO THINK 
ABOUT NONPHARMACOLOGICAL 
APPROACHES TO NEUROPSYCHIATRIC 
SYMPTOMS. AND FOCUS ON 
WELL-BEING AS A KEY OUTCOME. 
 ACCESS TO CARE SHOULD CONSIDER 
FINANCIAL AND SYSTEMIC 
BARRIERS.  AND SUPPORT AXIS TWO 
SUPPORTS AND SERVICES FOR 
PEOPLE WHO LIVE ALONE. 
WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT 
PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS, AND HOW 
THEY CAN ACCESS QUALITY CARE. 
THERE WAS A COMMENT I RECEIVED 
VIA EMAIL THAT SAID "AN OUNCE 
OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND 
OF CURE."
SHOULD PREVENTION BE A HIGHER 
PRIORITY? IS CURRENTLY RANKED 
AT NUMBER 4. 
WE WILL CONSIDER THAT AS A 
STEERING COMMITTEE.
AND ALSO AS A SUGGESTION TO 
PARTNER WITH CELEBRITY ADVOCATE 
TO GET OUR MESSAGES OUT. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
IN THE FTD SESSION IT WAS 
HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE HIGHEST 
PRIORITY IS RESEARCH TO IMPROVE 
DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. THIS 
WAS REALLY GUIDED BY SOMEONE 
WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE. AND 
THERE WAS AN IMPORTANT 
DISCUSSION ABOUT POTENTIAL 
THERAPEUTIC TARGETS. 
WE NEED TREATMENTS WITH MORE 
THAN A MODEST EFFECT THAT CAN 
WORK FOR PATIENTS AT DIFFERENT 
STAGES OF DISEASE. 
PUBLIC/ PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS 
ARE ESSENTIAL. AND THERE WAS A 
SENSE OF URGENCY AT THIS 
SESSION. 
ONE QUOTE I RECEIVED VIA EMAIL 
FROM THE VIDEOCAST WAS, "FTD IS 
UNIQUELY CRUEL BECAUSE IT OFTEN 
AFFECTS A PERSON IN THE PRIME 
OF THEIR CAREER AND THE COST OF 
LOST PRODUCTIVITY IS HUGELY 
IMPACTFUL FOR FAMILIES. OFTEN 
BOTH THE PATIENT AND THE 
CAREGIVER ARE FORCED TO LEAVE 
THEIR CAREERS AND ARE STUCK IN 
THIS SITUATION FOR MANY 
TORTURERS, AND DISABLED YEARS. 
NIH PLEASE HELP US END FTD."
I THINK WE FEEL THIS URGENCY. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
FTD POST TDI, WE NEED TO THINK 
ILLICITLY AND COLLABORATE WITH 
THE BROADER FIELD BECAUSE TDI 
IS TRULY AN MED. 
LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN 
MORE ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF 
DOMESTIC PARTNER VIOLENCE AND 
UNDERSTAND HOW TBI IN LATE LIFE 
INTERACT WITH OTHER 
NEURODEGENERATIVE PROCESSES,  
AND COLLABORATE WITH 
INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH 
COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY WITH 
COUNTRIES WITH EXTENSIVE 
HISTORY OF COMBAT RELATED TBIS. 
MED - LATE. 
WE GOT SOME HELPFUL COMMENTS 
FROM SOME OF WE LIVED 
EXPERIENCE WITH SAID IT WAS A 
GAME CHANGER TO FIND OUT THE 
ACTUAL DIAGNOSIS, GETTING THE 
WORD OUT IS EVERYTHING. 
WE NEED TO EDUCATE FAMILIES 
ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT. EDUCATE 
CLINICIANS INCLUDING PRIMARY 
CARE, AND DEVELOP CARE 
GUIDELINES AND WE NEED 
BIOMARKERS FOR LATE. 
DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS IS ONLY 
POSSIBLE AT AUTOPSY. THIS IS A 
HUGE BARRIER FOR CLINICAL 
TRIALS AND FOR DIAGNOSIS. BUT 
IT ALSO AFFECTS OUR STUDY OF 
OTHER PATHOLOGIES. 
FOR EXAMPLE WE NEED TO RULE OUT 
TDP-43 WHEN WE ARE SELECTING 
PATIENTS FOR AN AD TREATMENT 
TRIAL. 
WE ALSO NEED TO ADDRESS 
CONSISTENCIES AND DIAGNOSIS OF 
HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS, AND 
ADVANCED RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY 
THE CHARACTERISTIC SIGNATURES 
OF LATE WITH OR WITHOUT AD 
CO-PATHOLOGY USING 
RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
IN THE CLINICAL AND BASIC 
SCIENCE SESSION, WE HEARD INPUT 
THAT WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON 
THAT COMBINATION OF AD AND  
VASCULAR. 
WE NEED RESEARCH ON THE 
RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF EACH 
ETIOLOGY, IN A WAY THAT WILL 
HELP PATIENTS AND FAMILIES. 
FOR BIOMARKERS WE NEED TO MAKE 
SURE WE ARE RECOMMENDING 
RESEARCH THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH. 
AND THERE WAS EMPHASIS ON 
COLLECTING BIOMARKERS IN A 
STANDARDIZED WAY TO SUPPORT 
HARMONIZATION. 
AI AND  ADVANCED STATISTICAL 
METHODS ARE NEEDED, BUT FOR 
THESE TO WORK WELL WE NEED THAT 
COMMON CLASSIFICATION. 
THE EYE IS A WINDOW TO THE 
BRAIN AND THERE WAS TALK OF 
EXPANDING MODELS. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND LBD. WE TALKED ABOUT 
HARMONIZING DATA SETS AND 
SAMPLES ACROSS COHORTS. AND 
BETTER UNDERSTANDING AT A 
FUNCTIONAL LEVEL WHY THERE IS 
CELLULAR DYSFUNCTION IN 
DEMENTIA WITHOUT 
NEURODEGENERATION. 
AND FINALLY WANT TO THINK ABOUT 
RESEARCH ON A-SYNUCLEIN CO 
PATHOLOGY IN PEOPLE WITH DOWN 
SYNDROME AND AD. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR 
PATIENTS TO ENGAGE PHYSICALLY 
BUT ALSO SOCIALLY SO WE NEED TO 
CONSIDER THIS IN OUR 
RECOMMENDATIONS. CONSIDER THE 
EXPOZOME AND THEIR EFFECTS ON 
VCID. AND SEE ABOUT HOW DO THE 
MEDS INTERACT WITH THEIR IN 
DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE BRAIN 
AND LASTLY MAKE SURE TO THINK 
ABOUT VASODILATION AND CCA IN 
OUR RESEARCH. 
IN THE CLOSING SESSION WE HAD 
REALLY FANTASTIC INPUT AND I 
HAVE TAKEN NOTE OF ALL OF IT 
AND NOT GOING TO REVIEWED HERE 
BECAUSE YOU WERE JUST THERE. 
BUT WILL CONSIDER ALL THE GREAT 
INPUT WE GOT IN THAT SESSION. 
NEXT SLIDE. 
SO IN CLOSING, I WANT TO 
EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO OUR 
COLLEAGUES AT NINDS AND ALS AT 
NIH FOR MAKING SOME IT 
HAPPENED. 
OVER THESE LAST FEW MONTHS MANY 
OF OUR COLLEAGUES AT NIH AND AT 
SOME OF THE FEDERAL AGENCIES 
HAVE FACED UNANTICIPATED 
CHALLENGES.  CHANGES IN THE 
RULES COVERING THEIR WORK AND 
IN DOWNSIZING THEIR TEAMS. 
WHETHER WE AGREE WITH THE 
CHANGES ARE NOT, THEY HAVE 
ADDED EXTRA CHALLENGES FOR OUR 
NIH COLLEAGUES IN PREPARING 
THIS SUMMIT. 
FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF THE NIH 
LEADS AND STAFF WHO WERE 
WORKING ON THE SUMMIT WHEN WE 
STARTED ARE NO LONGER EMPLOYED 
AT NIH. 
AND ALSO, CHALLENGES WERE FACED 
IN SETTING THE SUMMIT DATES, 
AND GETTING THEM APPROVED AND 
AS WE SHIFT FROM IMPERSONAL 
MEETING TO VIRTUAL, FINDING A 
TECHNOLOGY PROBLEM THAT WILL 
WORK FOR THIS MEETING AND ALSO 
WAS ALLOWABLE. THAT WAS A 
CHALLENGE. 
AND SO THIS SUMMIT WOULD NOT 
HAVE HAPPENED IF NOT FOR THE 
PERSISTENCE, CREATIVITY AND THE 
DEDICATION OF OUR NIH 
COLLEAGUES. 
 I WANT TO THANK THE NIH STAFF 
TO WORK ON THE SUMMIT AND THE 
LOGISTICS CONTRACTOR AND I WANT 
TO SPECIFICALLY THANK AMBER 
MCCARTNEY FOR HER LEADERSHIP. 
SHE HAS WORKED TERRIBLY WITH A 
HUMBLE SPIRIT AND NEVER GAVE UP 
ON OUR GOAL TO HOST THIS SUMMIT 
NO MATTER THE CHALLENGES. 
I ALSO WANT TO SPECIFICALLY 
THANK ROD -- WHO LED THE PRIOR 
ADRD SUMMITS AND I WANT TO WISH 
HIM WELL ON HIS NEXT STEPS 
GUIDING ADRD WORK. 
WITH JOIN ME BY USING THE REACT 
FEATURE AT THE TOP OF YOUR 
BROWSER, IN OFFERING GRATITUDE 
FOR THE WORK AND DEDICATION OF 
OUR COLLEAGUES AT NIH. 
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
THOSE 
KIND WORDS. 
IT IS REALLY AN HONOR TO BE 
ABLE TO DO THIS AND LEAD THIS 
SUMMIT. IT IS REALLY AN 
IMPORTANT EVENT. 
WE WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL FOR 
ALL THE INPUT FROM PEOPLE THAT 
WE RECEIVED IN THE COMMITTEE 
SENT TO THE LAST TWO DAYS.
AND WE ARE NOT DONE. WE'RE 
GOING TO HAVE A THIRD DAY ON 
JUNE 2. 
&gt;&gt; DR. POSSIN: NEXT SLIDE
WHILE 
AMBER IS TALKING. 
&gt;&gt; PERFECT.  THANK YOU. 
&gt;&gt; DR. POSSIN: ALL RIGHT
WELL 
THANK YOU. AND YES THANK YOU 
ALL FOR BEING HERE AND WE 
REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO A 
WONDERFUL THIRD DAY THE SUMMIT. 
SEE YOU THEN.
