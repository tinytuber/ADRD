&gt;&gt; OKAY.
GOOD MORNING.
I'M WALTER KOROSHETZ THE 
DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF 
DISORDERS AND STROKE AND THIS IS
THE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE-RELATED 
DIMENTIAS SUMMIT FOR 2025.
CAN EVERYBODY HEAR ME OKAY?
THUMBS UP, GREAT.
I WANT TO THANK THE PEOPLE WHO 
DID ALL THE WORK INCLUDING 
PEOPLE HERE AT NINDS AND 
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AGING AND 
PARTICULARLY THE WORKING GROUPS 
YOU'LL HEAR FROM TODAY WHO 
BROUGHT TO YOU RESEARCH 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUR 
CONSIDERATION AND FOR INPUT AND 
THESE WILL THEN BE PRESENTED TO 
THE NINDS COUNCIL FOR FORMAL 
ADOPTION AND THANKS TO DR. POZEN
SHORE CHAIRING THE WORK GROUPS 
THAT LED UP TO THE SUMMIT.
SO THIS IS THE SLIDE THAT JUST 
REINFORCES WHAT WE ALL KNOW THAT
THE PUBLIC BURDEN AND SUFFERING 
DUE TO DEMENTIA IS INCREASING 
AROUND THE WORLD AND THIS IS 
FROM THE DISEASE STUDY AND THE 
INCREASE IN BURDEN OF DISEASE IS
PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE AGING OF
THE POPULATION.
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE AGE 
STANDARD PREVALENCE IT'S FAIRLY 
FLAT, SOME INCREASE BUT PRETTY 
FLAT AND IF YOU LOOK ON THE 
RIGHT-HAND SIDE YOU SEE THE 
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AFFECTED OVER 
TIME AS THE POPULATION AGES.
SO, THAT'S TRUE GLOBALLY AND 
CERTAINLY TRUE IN THE UNITED 
STATES AND WHY ADDRESSING 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND RELATED 
DEMENTIA IS A NATIONAL PRIORITY.
THE NATIONAL PLAN TO ADDRESS 
THIS BURDEN OF ILLNESS WAS 
ORIGINALLY RELEASED IN 2012.
IT'S UPDATED ANNUALLY.
IT CALLS FOR ACTION TO 
ACCELERATE RESEARCH AND IMPROVE 
CARE IN SERVICES FOR PEOPLE 
LIVING WITH DEMENTIA AND THAT'S 
DEFINED FOR THESE PURPOSE AS 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, VASCULAR 
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND LEWY 
BODY DEMENTIA WHICH IS THE 
CONDITION THAT AFFECTS PEOPLE 
WITH PARKINSON'S WHO THEN 
DEVELOP DEMENTIA.
SOME PEOPLE WITH THIS DISEASE 
DEVELOP DEMENTIA EVEN BEFORE THE
PARKINSON'S SYMPTOMS AND FRONTAL
TEMPORAL DEMENTIA AND THE BURDEN
OF ILLNESS FALLS CLEARLY ON THE 
PEOPLE AFFECTED BUT ALSO ON THE 
FAMILIES WHO CARE FOR THESE 
FOLKS.
THE NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S ACT WAS
AUTHORIZED IN 2011 AND HELD BY 
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND IN
EVALUATION WITH NIH AND OTHER 
AGENCIES CONTRIBUTING AND 
INCLUDES SIX KEY GOALS COVERING 
RISK REDUCTION, WHICH IS ALWAYS 
THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU
THE GREATEST PUBLIC HEALTH 
IMPACT IN TERMS OF PREVENTION, 
TREATMENT CARE SUPPORT AND 
PUBLIC AWARENESS.
THE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON 
ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH CARE AND 
SERVICES MEETS REGULARLY.
IT HAS 12 PUBLIC MEMBERS 
REPRESENTING PATIENT ADVOCATES, 
CAREGIVERS, PROVIDERS, STATE AND
LOCAL GOVERNMENT REPS, 
RESEARCHERS, VOLUNTARY HEALTH 
ASSOCIATION REPRESENTATIVES AND 
CHAIRED CURRENTLY BY DR. MIMS 
AND IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TO WORK
WITH ADRIAN OVER THE YEARS.
YOU SEE ON THE RIGHT SIDE THE 
NUMBER OF FEDERAL AGENCIES 
INVOLVED IN THE ADVISORY COUNCIL
ON ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH CARE AND
SERVICES AND FOR EACH THERE'S A 
SUBCOMMITTEE THAT WORKS AS A 
COMMITTEE AND PREVENTION 
COMMITTEE AND RISK REDUCTION 
COMMITTEE.
WHAT WE DO IS SAID THE ADRD 
MILESTONES AND WE DO THAT 
THROUGH PEOPLE WORKING BEHIND 
THE SCENES TO DEVELOP 
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE THEN 
VETTED AT SUMMITS SUCH AS THE 
ONES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
THERE ARE RESEARCH SUMMITS ON 
CARE AND SERVICES FOR PERSONS 
WITH DEMENTIA AND THEIR 
CAREGIVERS AND THEY'RE RAN BY 
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF AGING
AN ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH SUMMIT 
AGAIN RAN BY THE NATIONAL 
INSTITUTE OF AGING AND NINDS 
RUNS THE ONE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
TODAY WHICH IS ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE RELATED RESEARCH SUMMIT.
THE SUMMITS REFLECT CRITICAL 
SCIENTIFIC PRIORITIES AS BROUGHT
TO THE FOREFRONT BY WORKING 
GROUPS THAT INCLUDE SCIENTISTS, 
CAREGIVERS AND HEALTH CARE 
PROVIDERS.
LEADING UP TO THE SUMMIT 
SUBCOMMITTEES WORK ON 
PARTICULARLY DEEP DIVES INTO 
AREAS THOUGHT TO BE ESPECIALLY 
IMPORTANT IN THEIR SUMMITS AND 
STARTING TODAY THOSE PRIORITIES 
FOR THE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
RELATED SUMMIT WILL BE REPORTED 
OUT FOR YOUR INPUT AND 
CONSIDERATION.
THIS PROFESSIONAL -- THESE PLANS
ALL GO INTO DEVELOPING THE 
ANNUAL ADRD PROFESSIONAL 
JUDGMENT BUDGET AS WELL AS THE 
2024 ADRD PROGRESS REPORT.
THAT PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT 
BUDGET GOES STRAIGHT TO HHS AND 
THEN IS CONSIDERED BY THE 
CONGRESS AND SET BY 
APPROPRIATION OF CONGRESS AND 
THEY ESTIMATE THE ANNUAL BUDGET 
FUNDING NEEDED TO LEVERAGE 
SCIENTIFIC OPPORTUNITIES IN 
DEMENTIA RESEARCH AND THE 
CONGRESS HAS BEEN EXTREMELY 
GENEROUS IN TERMS OF INVESTING 
IN THE FUTURE OF THIS RESEARCH 
OVER THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN 
YEARS.
I WOULD SAY THE ANNUAL REPORT IS
NOW AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE.
IN TERMS OF ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE-RELATED DIMENTIAS WHAT 
WE CONCENTRATE ON ARE THE 
VASCULAR CONTRIBUTIONS AND WEAR 
AND TEAR ON THE BLOOD VESSELS IN
THE BRAIN CAUSING ISSUES SUCH AS
STROK
STROKES MANY TURN OUT TO BE SUB 
CLINICAL AND THEY SEEM TO BE 
RELATED TO DEVELOPING RISK OF 
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT DIM EN IS 
THAT OF AGING.
THERE'S ALSO A VERY INTERESTING 
CONDITION THAT'S EXTREMELY 
COMMON WE CALL WHITE MATTER 
DISEASE.
THIS IS USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH 
CHANGES IN THE BLOOD VESSELS BUT
THE WHITE MATTER ARE THE C
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE BRAIN 
AREAS AND WE SEE ABNORMALITIES 
IN THE AREAS THAT COMPOSE THE 
WIRES.
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT
CAUSES THE CHANGES TO OCCUR BUT 
ALSO ASSOCIATED WHITE MATTER 
DISEASE WITH HYPERTENSION AND 
LEAD TO COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT.
LEWY BODY DEMENTIA ARE THE 
PATHOLOGICAL HALLMARK ARE LEWY 
BODIES AN AGGREGATE OF SINUCLEIN
AND THEY DEVELOP MOTOR TROUBLE 
AND THE AREA OF LEWY BODY 
DIMENSION.
FRONTAL TEMPORAL DEMENTIA AND 
OCCUR YOUNGER AND AFFECTS PEOPLE
IN THEIR 50s AROUND 60s.
CAUSES SOCIAL DECLINE IN 
BEHAVIOR AND LANGUAGE AND 
THEY'LL PRESENT TO A 
PSYCHIATRIST FIRST BECAUSE OF 
CHANGES IN THEIR BEHAVIOR AND 
ALSO SEEN IN AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL
SCLEROSIS AND CORRELATION IN THE
GENETIC FORMS AND IN THE OTHER 
FORMS OF FTD.
A BIG AREA OF INVESTIGATION IS 
AROUND MIXED DEMENTIAS.
WHEN SOMEONE LOOKS IN THE BRAIN 
OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED WHO HAD 
DEMENTIA, THE OLDER YOU ARE THE 
MORE LIKELY YOU WILL HAVE A MIX 
OF MULTIPLE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS
GOING ON TO CAUSE DEMENTIA AND 
THAT REALLY GETS THINGS 
COMPLICATED BECAUSE TREATMENTS 
WILL HAVE TO AFFECT ALL OR WILL 
HAVE TO HAVE SPECIFIC TREATMENTS
FOR EACH OF THE DIFFERENT 
ETIOLOGIES THAT GO ON TO CREATE 
THE TROUBLE FOR THE PEOPLE AS 
THEY AGE.
THAT'S A BIG AREA OF CONCERN AND
WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT.
WE'LL LOOK AT THE MECHANISMS 
CAUSALLY RELATED TO THE 
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT OF DEMENTIA
BY THIS TIME OF BASIC RESEARCH.
WE UNDERSTAND WHY WE CAN 
INTERVENE TO TRY TO REVERSE THE 
PROCESS THAT LEADS TO COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT AND DEMENTIA.
THAT'S ONE OF OUR BIG AREAS OF 
FOCUS AT THE NIH.
BUT THE JOB IS NOT TO PUBLISH A 
LOT OF PAPERS AND END IT THERE.
THE JOB IS TO MOVE FROM THE 
DISCOVERY IN THE LABORATORIES TO
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THERAPEUTICS 
AND THAT REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING 
WHAT ARE TARGETS THAT COME FROM 
THE BASIC MECHANISMS OF DISEASE 
THAT COULD BE DRUGGABLE.
INCLUDES DEVELOPMENT OF 
BIOMARKERS THAT CAN IDENTIFY 
PEOPLE WITH PARTICULAR 
ETIOLOGIES AS WE MENTIONED 
BEFORE.
THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE 
ETIOLOGIES.
WE NEED THE BIOMARKERS TO 
IDENTIFY WHO IS GOING TO RESPOND
TO WHAT TYPE OF TREATMENT 
DEPENDING ON WHAT THE TARGET OF 
THAT TREATMENT IS.
IN ADDITION BECAUSE DEMENTIA 
OCCURS SLOWLY OVER TIME A STUDY 
TO DEFINE A TREATMENT CANNOT 
RELY ON SAY LOOKING FOR SEVEN TO
10 YEARS DOWN THE ROAD TO SEE 
HOW IT WORKS.
WE NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS MUCH 
MORE QUICKLY IN TERMS OF WHAT 
TYPE OF DRUGS, SAY, FOR INSTANCE
NEED TO GO INTO THOSE LONGER 
TRIALS AND THERE WE NEED 
BIOMARKERS WE CALL TARGET 
ENGAGEMENT TO KNOW THE DRUG IS 
DOING WHAT YOU WANT IT TO DO.
AND THAT IS REALLY CRUCIAL 
PARTICULARLY NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE
SO MANY DIFFERENT TARGETS THAT 
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE 
BASIC SCIENCE.
THE BOTTLENECK IS OFTEN 
IDENTIFYING WHICH ONES ARE 
ROBUST ENOUGH THEY CAN REALLY 
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE AND 
THIS IS WHERE WE NEED THE 
BIOMARKERS TO MAKE THOSE EARLY 
TYPE OF DECISIONS GO, NO-GO 
DECISIONS BEFORE ENTERING THE 
LONG CLINICAL TRIALS.
BUT THE CLINICAL TRIALS ARE 
CLEARLY THE END GAME HERE IS TO 
SHOW IN A RIGOROUS WAY WHETHER A
TREATMENT IS WORKING OR NOT AND 
WHAT IS THE AFFECT SIZE OF THAT 
TREATMENT, WHAT ARE THE RISKS 
AND BENEFITS AND THEREFORE TO 
INFORM THE PUBLIC ON HOW THEY 
SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH 
THEIRSELVES  -- THEMSELVES OR 
LOVED ONES.
THE RESEARCH SYNERGIZES WITH 
OTHER NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS.
WE MENTIONED VASCULAR COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT AS A KEY FEATURE OF 
THE ADRDs AND THERE'S INFORMED 
BY WORK ON STROKE AND 
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN THE 
LAST 50 YEARS.
SIMILARLY YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT 
INFLAMMATION INVOLVED IN THE 
DAMAGE THAT OCCURS IN THE 
NEUROGENERATIVE DISEASES AND SO 
RESEARCH OVER THE LAST 50 YEARS 
WE LEARNED A LOT AND IN NO 
INSTANCE HAVE WE LEARNED 
EVERYTHING BUT WE LEARNED A LOT 
ABOUT THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES
IN THE BRAIN AND THESE ARE ALL 
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOW AS 
FOUNDATIONS TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO
DEVELOP TREATMENTS FOR THESE 
DISORDERS.
SO, THE SLIDE JUST BASICALLY 
INDICATES HOW COMPLICATED THE 
SITUATION IS.
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU ARE 
DEALING WITH MULTI-ETIOLOGY DIM 
EN -- DEMENTIAS YOU HAVE THE 
SIGNATURE OF NEURO DEGENERATIVE 
DISEASES AND TAU IS A PROTEIN 
THAT AGGREGATES INSIDE THE CELLS
AND COMES LATER AND SEEMS TO BE 
ASSOCIATED WITH DEATH OF THE 
CELLS OPPOSED TO AMYLOID ITSELF.
TAU IS ALSO A PROTEIN THAT ONE 
SEES IN THE FRONTAL DEMENTIAS 
AND PEOPLE ARE DIAGNOSED WITH 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND SIMILAR 
WE'LL SEE IN MANY PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE DEMENTIA DIAGNOSES DISEASE 
HAS EVIDENCE OF SYNUCLEIN 
AGGREGATION AND THIS HAPPENS 
OVER TIME AND WHY SOME PEOPLE 
ARE RESILIENT AND HAVE THE 
PATHOLOGIES BUT COGNITIVELY 
NORMAL ARE INTERESTING QUESTION 
TO PURSUE.
ARE THERE THINGS IN PHYSICAL 
ACTIVITY, DIET OR ALCOHOL OR 
DRUG USE OR ENVIRONMENTAL 
FACTORS, PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS, 
METABOLIC FACTORS THAT GO ON TO 
INFLUENCE THE PROGRESSION OF 
THESE DISEASES ARE AREAS OF 
GREAT INTEREST AT THIS TIME.
HERE IS JUST A SLIDE TO SHOW IN 
THE STUDY A RELIGIOUS ORDER 
STUDY OUT OF CHICAGO.
ONE CAN SEE AND IF YOU LOOK AT 
PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY, FEW OF 
THEM HAVE ALZHEIMER'S ALONE.
AD VASCULAR IS COMMON AND FOR 
OTHER DEMENTIAS ALSO VERY 
COMMON.
FOR THE MAJORITY OF FOLKS WILL 
HAVE A MIX OF PATHOLOGIES IN THE
ELDERLY STATE.
SOME FOLKS DEVELOP DEMENTIA 
EARLIER ON AND THEY'RE LIKELY TO
HAVE A PURER FORM OF ONE OF 
THESE TYPES OF DEMENTIAS BUT THE
PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE IS IN OUR 
AGING POPULATION AND THERE WE 
HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO BEST 
APPROACH THE ISSUE OF 
MULTIETIOLOGY DEMENTIAS.
I MENTIONED BIOMARKERS AND THIS 
IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE SYNUCLEIN 
BIOPSIES AND YOU CAN SEE IN THE 
SPINAL FLUID AND THEY BECOME 
ABNORMAL POTENTIALLY 10 YEARS 
BEFORE ANYONE SHOWS SIGNS OF 
THEIR NEUROLOGICAL TROUBLES.
ON ONE HAND IT'S VERY 
ENCOURAGING WE HAVE TREATMENTS 
WE CAN IDENTIFY PEOPLE EVEN 
BEFORE THEY GET SYMPTOMS AND IF 
WE CAN INTERVENE EFFECTIVELY 
THERE, THEN WE'RE BASICALLY CURE
THE DISEASE.
SO THAT'S KIND OF THE HOLY GRAIL
WE'RE HOPING THESE BIOMARKERS 
WHEN LINKED WITH EFFECTIVE 
TREATMENT.
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A PHOSPHO 
TAU BIOMARKER THAT AGGREGATES 
INSIDE THE CELLS AND GENERALLY 
THEN KILLS THE CELLS.
THESE ARE BLOOD TESTS THE 
SYNUCLEIN TEST OF SKIN OR SPINAL
FLUID AND THESE ARE BLOOD TESTS 
THAT CAN LOOK AT PHOSPHORO TAU 
IN FOLKS AND YOU CAN SEE IF YOU 
HAVE A LOW LEVEL, THEN YOU'RE 
LIKELY TO HAVE NORMAL COGNITION 
OVER TIME AND IF YOU HAVE A HIGH
LEVEL, THEN YOU'RE AT RISK FOR 
DECLINING OVER TIME.
SO THIS IS STARTING WITH PEOPLE 
WHO ARE COGNITIVELY NORMAL AND 
SHOWING THIS IS A MARKER OF 
DECLINE TOWARDS DEMENTIA.
THERE ARE NEW BIOMARKERS THAT 
HAVE RECENTLY BEEN DISCOVERED 
AND YET TO BE VALIDATED AND HAVE
GONE TO A COMMERCIAL PROCESS AS 
SOME OF THE ABETA AND TAU 
BIOMARKERS HAVE ALREADY DONE.
THIS IS A STUDY SHOWING THAT 
THERE ARE TWO PROTEINS.
THEY HAVE FUNNY NAMES, YWHHA IS 
ONE AND THE OTHER IS MPTX2.
THE OTHER TENDS TO GO UP WITH 
DEMENTIA AND THE SECOND GOES 
DOWN.
SO THE RATIO OF WHAT THEY'RE 
MEASURING NOW IS SHOWING -- WE 
COMPARE IT TO AMYLOID AND TAU BY
ITSELF AND THIS IS MUCH MORE OF 
A ROBUST MARKER.
BUT IT IS A SPINAL FLUID TEST.
JUST AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THESE 
FIELDS ARE PROGRESSING AND 
VALUABLE BIOMARKERS, BLOOD AND 
SPINAL FLUID AND ACTUALLY I 
SHOULD MENTION THE RATIO IS ALSO
ABNORMAL IN THE BLOOD AS WELL.
BUT TIME AND STUDIES IN THOUSAND
OF PEOPLE NOW VALIDATING THE 
BIOMARKERS WHICH WILL BE HIGHLY 
PREDICTIVE.
THE AREA OF COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT
DUE TO DUE TO VASCULAR DISEASE.
THERE'S VASCULAR CHANGES THAT 
OCCUR DUE TO DEMENTIA DUE TO THE
BREAD AND BUTTER TYPE OF SEVERAL
VASCULAR DISEASE.
WE SEE THE HYPERTENSION IN AGING
AND ALZHEIMER'S ITSELF IS 
ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES AND HOW 
BLOOD FLOWS FROM THE BRAIN AND 
HOW OXYGEN IS SUPPLIED.
ONE OF THE MAJOR PROGRAMS FROM 
THE ADRD IS LOOKING AT THE 
CHANGES IN THE BLOOD VESSELS IN 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIS WHAT WE 
CALL SMALL VESSEL DISEASE OR 
WHITE MATTER DISEASE I MENTIONED
EARLIER.
AND WE CAN SEE HERE WE'RE 
WORKING TO DEVELOP A MARKER THAT
WE CAN MEASURE AND CORRELATE 
WITH THIS AMOUNT OF MRI 
ABNORMALITY WE SEE AS WELL AS 
THE COGNITIVE IMPAIRED AND THIS 
SHOWS HOW BLOOD FLOW CHANGES 
WHEN THE BRAIN IS ACTIVATED OR 
THE BLOOD VESSELS ARE STRESSED 
TO DILATE IS ABNORMAL IN FOLKS 
AS THEY DEVELOP COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT AND THIS IS SHOWING 
THE GRAPHS IN MULTIPLE DIFFERENT
INSTITUTIONS INDICATING IT'S A 
FAIRLY ROBUST FINDING THAT CAN 
BE REPRODUCED AT MULTIPLE 
DIFFERENT PLACES.
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS WE
DEVELOP TREATMENTS TO TRY TO 
IMPROVE.
KTB43 IS ANOTHER PROTEIN THAT 
AGGREGATES IN SIDE THE NEURONS 
IN FOLKS WITH ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE.
AS WELL AS THE FRONTAL DEMENTIAS
AND ALS.
OF NOTE, THIS PROTEIN IS 
INVOLVED IN THE SPLICING OF 
MESSENGER RNA.
MESSENGER RNA IS MADE FROM THE 
DNA AND PROTEINS ARE MADE OFF OF
THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE 
MESSENGER RNA AND MESSENGER RNA 
IS BROKEN UP INTO PIECES TO 
CAUSE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF AMINO 
ACIDS IN YOUR PROTEINS.
TDP-43 IS INVOLVED IN THE 
SPLICING FUNCTION AND WHEN IT 
AGGREGATES, IT CAN'T DO THAT.
SO ONE SEES PROTEINS THAT HAVE 
THICK -- HAVE PIECES IN IT THAT 
SHOULD BE SPLICED OUT BUT 
THEY'RE NOT BECAUSE OF THE 
TPD-43 DYSFUNCTION AND THESE ARE
CALLED CRYPTIC PROTEINS AND 
THESE ARE POTENTIALLY GOING TO 
BE VERY GOOD MARKERS OF TDP-43 
IMMIGRATION IN THE BRAIN OF 
PEOPLE WITH FRONTAL TEMPORAL 
DEMENTIA AND PARKINSON'S AND 
ALZHEIMER'S AND ALS.
AND THERE'S INTERESTING 
TECHNOLOGIES ON THE RIGHT OF THE
SLIDE PEOPLE ARE USING 
SOPHISTICATED GENOMIC TECHNIQUES
TO BASICALLY GET RID OF THE PATH
LOGIC ABNORMALITIES.
SO IN THIS CASE THERE'S A GROUP 
WORKING WITH A PARTICULAR 
ARTIFICIAL GENE THAT CAN GET IN 
THE NEURONS BUT IT'S ONLY GOING 
TO BE ACTIVE IN THE NEURONS THAT
HAVE TDP-43 WHERE THEY GO SPLICE
OUT A CRYPTIC PEPTIDE AND IN 
THOSE NEURONS THE PEPTIDE 
ARTIFICIAL GENE WILL BE ACTIVE 
AND NORMALIZE THE CRYPTIC 
SPLICING OF THE ABNORMALITY AND 
PEOPLE CAN USE GENOMIC 
TECHNIQUES IN THE LABORATORY AND
ANIMAL MODELS THAT HOPEFULLY CAN
MOVE INTO PEOPLE.
THE POWER OF THESE IS COMPARED 
TO DRUGS THEY'RE ONLY ACTIVE 
EXACTLY WHERE YOU WANT THEM TO 
BE ACTIVE.
SO LIKELY WE CAN GET BIG EFFECT 
SIZES WITH VERY FEW SIDE 
EFFECTS.
AND THAT'S CERTAINLY THE TRICK.
IN TERMS OF THE GENETIC TRICKS 
THE OTHER ONE IS GENE EDITING.
IN WHICH AN ABNORMAL PROTEIN CAN
BE ACTUALLY NORMALIZED BY 
BASICALLY GOING IN AND CUTTING 
OUT THE ABNORMAL PIECE IN AN 
ALZHEIMER'S MODEL IN CUT OUT THE
AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN THAT 
PREVENTS IT FROM BECOMING 
PATHOLOGIC.
WE'LL SEE MORE OF THESE.
THIS IS VERY EARLY IN 
DEVELOPMENT STAGE IN TERMS OF 
GENE EDITING.
THERE'S A COMMON FUND PROGRAM 
WE'RE INVOLVED WITH WHICH IS 
BASICALLY WORKING TO GET GENE 
EDITING TO THE PEOPLE IN 
DIFFERENT CONDITIONS.
AGAIN, A REALLY EXCITING WAY OF 
GETTING VERY PRECISE TREATMENTS 
TO RECTIFY GENETIC ABNORMALITIES
FOR HEALTH.
I MENTIONED EARLIER THERE ARE 
SOME REAL INTERESTING CLUES WHEN
WE LOOK AT PEOPLE TO BE VERY 
LATE AGE AND DO NOT HAVE 
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND THESE 
ARE EXAMPLES THAT ARE REALLY 
APPRECIATION IN THE SENSE THAT 
WHEN YOU FIND OUT WHAT IT IS 
THAT'S PROTECTING THEM, IF YOU 
CAN THEN DEVELOP A DRUG OR 
GENOMIC THERAPY TO MIMIC THAT 
PROTECTION, YOU CAN THEN PROTECT
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALL DIFFERENT 
FORMS OF THE DISEASE.
SO, BY STUDYING THE FOUR 
POPULATIONS, YOU CAN FIND 
TREATMENTS THAT CAN BE 
GENERALIZED TO BIG POPULATIONS.
THE TWO MENTIONED HERE ARE 
REELIN A CERTAIN ISOFORM OF 
REELIN FIND PEOPLE WHO HAVE A 
GENETIC MUTATION THAT SHOULD 
GIVE THEM ALZHEIMER'S BUT 
THEY'RE COGNITIVELY NORMAL.
SOMEHOW THE REELIN ISOFORM IS 
PROTECTING THEM AND THE APOE 3 
IS DOING SOMETHING SIMILAR.
THE IDEA TO FIND OUT WHAT THE 
APOE 3 IS DOING AND FIND PEOPLE 
AT RISK FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
AND SIMILARLY WITH THE REELIN 
ISOFORM.
THESE ARE CLOSE TO BEING 
FOLLOWED UP FOR NEW TREATMENTS.
THE OTHER THING TO MENTION, I 
BRIEFLY HIT ON THIS EARLIER IS 
THAT IN ALL THE 
NEURODEGENERATIONS THERE'S AN 
INFLAMMATORY REACTION.
WE THINK OF INFLAMMATION WITH 
INFECTION, SAY, FOR INSTANCE, 
WHERE THE INFLAMMATION COMES AND
IT CONTROLS THE BACTERIA OR THE 
VIRUS THAT'S CAUSING YOUR 
INFECTION.
BUT IT TURNS OUT IN THE NERVOUS 
SYSTEM, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS 
ACTIVE ALL THE TIME IN RESHAPING
THE SYNAPSES BETWEEN THE CELLS 
AND IN PROTECTING THE BRAIN 
AGAINST BACTERIA AND VIRUSES.
BUT IN SOME INSTANCES IN 
NEURODEGENERATION IT APPEARS THE
IMMUNE SYSTEM BECOMES OVER 
ACTIVE AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE
DAMAGE.
SO SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF 
EXAMPLES.
THIS IS ONE OF THEM WHERE IT'S 
BEEN FOUND THAT KEY CELLS WHICH 
ARE INFLAMMATORY CELLS CAN 
INVADE THE SURFACE OF THE BRAIN 
SUBSTANCE CALLED THE DURA MATTER
AND PRODUCE IL17 WHICH CREATES 
MACROPHAGES WHICH IS ANOTHER 
MORE AGGRESSIVE INFLAMMATORY 
CELL THAT CAN THEN INJURY 
ADJACENT CELLS AND GIVE RISE TO 
LOSS OF NEURONS AND SYNAPSES.
SO TARGETING THESE TYPES OF 
CELLS IS PARTICULAR INFLAMMATORY
CELLS MIGHT BE PROTECTIVE.
AND THIS EXAMPLE AS I MENTIONED 
IS ACTUALLY DRIVEN BY THE 
VASCULAR ABNORMALITIES ONE SEES 
IN VASCULAR COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT.
THERE'S ALSO RECENT STUDIES 
ABOUT APOE 4 WHICH IS ONE OF THE
HIGHEST RISK FACTORS FOR 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND 
PROGRESSION OF ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE.
AND THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT IN 
APOE 4, MICE ONE SEES AN 
ABNORMALITY IN CHOLESTEROL 
METABOLISM AND CHOLESTEROL 
ACCUMULATES INSIDE THE CELLS 
THAT RESULTS IN INHIBITION OF 
MYELIN BASED PROTEIN WHICH IS 
THE PROTEIN NEEDED TO COVER THE 
WIRES THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER 
THAT CONNECT TO DIFFERENT BRAIN 
REGIONS.
THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE
APOE 4 GENE WHICH IS A REAL BAD 
ACTOR IN ALZHEIMER'S AND 
VASCULAR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT OR
WHITE MATTER DISEASE.
FINALLY, I WANTED TO MENTION THE
WORK YOU'LL BE HEARING ABOUT AND
I DESCRIBED GOES ON AROUND 
UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
WE ARE INDEBTED SO THE PATIENTS 
AND THE SUBJECTS AND THE 
CAREGIVERS WHO TAKE TIME AND 
ENERGY TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE 
STUDIES.
AND IT'S ONLY THROUGH THIS 
COMMUNITY THAT WE HAVE BUILT 
OVER THE YEARS AND CONTINUE TO 
NURTURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
ADVANCES.
SIMILARLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE 
ALSO HAVE A PROGRAM HERE ON THE 
BETHESDA BUTS THE CENTER FOR 
ALZHEIMER RELATED DEMENTIAS 
USING SOME REALLY INNOVATIVE 
TECHNOLOGIES PARTICULARLY USING 
HUMAN CELLS TAKEN FROM PEOPLE 
SAY THE SKIN BIOPSY AND 
DEVELOPED INTO STUDY THE ROLE OF
FACTORS IN THE PATHOLOGY THAT WE
SEE IN THE CELLS OF PEOPLE WITH 
NEUROGET
NEUROGET  -- NEURODEGENERATIVE 
DISEASES AND AN INTERESTING 
STUDY AT THE CAMPUS.
ANOTHER AREA I THINK IS 
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT NOW IS 
UNDERSTANDING HOW TO IDENTIFY 
PEOPLE EARLY ON AS THEY DEVELOP 
NEURODEGENERATION AND THE 
EARLIER SIGNS OF COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT.
THE GENERAL RULE THAT WE SEE 
ASCRIBE TO IS THAT AS THIS 
PROCESS GOES ON AND ON IT GETS 
VERY HARD TO STOP IT.
THE BEST CHANCE OF MAKING A BIG 
DIFFERENCE IS GOING TO BE IN 
EARLY INTERVENTIONS.
THE BIOMARKER FIELD HAS 
PROGRESSED WHERE SOME WILL BE 
TURNING POSITIVE VERY EARLY ON 
EVEN BEFORE SYMPTOMS.
SO THAT'S VERY ENCOURAGING.
WE ALSO NEED WAYS IN WHICH WE 
CAN IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN 
COGNITION.
THIS IS THE STUDY CALLED T THE 
TECH PROGRAM TO DEVELOP A METHOD
WHEREBY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS 
HAVE THEIR FAMILY DOCTOR AND 
THAT WILL BE THE POINT TO WHERE 
THE PROBLEMS WILL BE FIRST ABLE 
TO BE DETECTED.
AND SO WE NEED METHODS AND THIS 
IS ONE OF THEM WHICH WAS QUITE 
SUCCESSFUL AT HELPING IN THE 
PRIMARY CARE SETTING TO IDENTIFY
PEOPLE WITH COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT.
IN THIS CASE IT SHOWED IT LED TO
IMPROVED DEMENTIA CARE.
SO EVEN WOULD THIS IDEA OF 
IDENTIFYING PEOPLE FOR THESE NEW
TREATMENTS OF THE FUTURE, THESE 
DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA CAN BE 
HELPFUL IN THE IMMEDIATE TIME 
FRAME.
SO WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS THINK 
ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE 
ARE SUFFERING WITH 
ALZHEIMER-RELATED DEMENTIAS AT 
EVERY COMPONENT OF THESE 
CONDITIONS, WE TRY TO DEVELOP 
RESEARCH THAT CAN ADVANCE THEIR 
TREATMENT, PREVENTION AND CARE.
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO 
HEARING FROM THE RECOMMENDATIONS
OF THE WORKING GROUPS AS THEY 
HAVE REALLY TAKEN ON THE 
CHALLENGE OF LOOKING AT A VERY 
COMPLICATED BUT VERY IMPORTANT 
AREA OF SCIENCE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
NOW I'LL HAND IT OVER TO AC BER 
MCCARTNEY LEADING THE SUMMIT 
FROM NINDS.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, WALTER.
-- AMBER MCCARTNEY.
&gt;&gt; AMBER: THIS SUMMARIZES
THE 
PLAN TO ADDRESS ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE.
I WANT TO MAKE ONE POINT, THAT'S
PLEASE FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION AT 
THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE.
HERE YOU CAN SEE UNDER THE FIRST
PROFESSIONAL PLAN THERE'S AN 
ACTION ITEM FOR US WHICH DIRECTS
US TO REGULARLY CONVENE A SUMMIT
ON ADRD RESEARCH.
THE SUMMIT THE PURPOSE IS TO 
REVIEW PROGRESS ON 
RECOMMENDATIONS AS APPROPRIATE 
BASED ON RECENT SCIENTIFIC 
DISCOVERIES AND THIS IS WHAT 
WE'RE HERE TO DO TODAY.
TODAY WE WANT YOUR INPUT ON THE 
DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS PRESENTED 
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW WE TAKE 
THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AND 
ENCOURAGE YOU TO STAY INVOLVED 
THROUGHOUT THE MULTI-DAY EVENT.
IN THE AGENDA YOU'LL SEE TIME 
DEDICATED PUBLIC INPUT IN EACH 
SESSION AND WHERE WE ENCOURAGE 
YOU TO PROVIDE INPUT AND 
FEEDBACK ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS.
HERE IS AN AGENDA FOR THE THREE 
DAYS AND FOR EACH SESSION YOU'LL
SEE THE NAME OF THE SESSION AND 
I'VE INDICATED THE NUMBER OF 
RECOMMENDATIONS EACH SESSION 
WILL PRESENT.
AS IN PREVIOUS YEARS, 
CROSS-CUTTING SECTION SUCH AS 
THE DISEASE SPECIFIC SESSION, 
EACH HAVE EIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS 
AND HAVE PRIORITY LEVELS 1-4.
THEY HAVE TWO NUMBER ONE AND TWO
NUMBER TWO PRIORITIES AND TWO 
NUMBER THREE PRIORITIES AND TWO 
NUMBER FOUR.
THE SPECIAL TOPIC SESSIONS EACH 
HAVE FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS WITH 
PRIORITY LEVELS 1-4.
ALL PRIORITIES PRESENTED ARE 
HIGHEST PRIORITIES FOR THE 
FIELD.
YOU'LL HEAR MORE IN THE FIRST 
SESSION LED BY DR. POSSIN.
THEY DECIDED TO SPLIT INTO TWO 
SUBCOMMITTEES AND START OFF DAYS
ONE AND TWO.
THE FIRST SESSION WILL START 
WITH INFLAMMATION AND THE SECOND
DAY IS RESEARCH.
COMBINED THEY PRESENT THE EIGHT 
EXISTING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE
ETIOLOGY DEMENTIA SESSION FROM 
2022.
I WANT TO POINT OUT IN ADDITION 
TO EACH SESSION, ENDING WITH 
DEDICATED MICRO PHOTI AND I'LL 
TALK ABOUT THE CONTEXT AND 
WHAT'S INVOLVED.
SO PLANNING STARTED SIX, SEVEN 
MONTHS AGO AND THE COMMITTEES 
INVOLVED OVER 120 SCIENTISTS, 
PHYSICIANS, PEOPLE WITH LIVED 
EXPERIENCE AND ADMINISTRATORS 
AND PARTNERS AND I'LL INTRODUCE 
DR. POSSIN.
SHE'LL SPEAK AFTER ME AND HOLDS 
THE JOHN DOUGLAS FRENCH ENDOWED 
PROFESSORSHIP IN THE DEPARTMENT 
OF NEUROLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY 
OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO AND 
PREVIOUSLY SHARED THE MULTIPLE 
ETIOLOGY DEMENTIA SESSION FOR 
TWO PREVIOUS SESSION AND THE 
LEADER IN DETECTION OF ATAXIA 
I.D. AND YOU HEARD WALTER TALK 
ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND A LEADER 
IN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL 
EFFORTS TO ADDRESS DEMENTIA IN 
EVERYDAY CLINICAL STUDIES WE 
HAVE AN ESTEEMED STEERING 
COMMITTEE OF CHAIRS AND 
PROMINENT LEADERS IN THE FIELD 
AND HERE AT THE SESSION AND 
MEETING GOALS.
THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE NIH 
RESEARCH SPENDING FOR 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RELATED 
DEMENTIA RESEARCH HAS INCREASED 
IN THE PAST DECADE.
THIS IS NOT A BUDGETING SLIDE 
BUT ACTUAL DOLLARS SPENT ON THE 
CATEGORIES OF RESEARCH AND IF 
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN DETAILS FOR
THESE NUMBERS, PLEASE GO TO THE 
NIH REPORTER WEBSITE THE ADDRESS
IS FOUND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE 
SLIDE.
THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THE 
RELATED DEMENTIAS STUDIES HAVE 
INCREASED AS WELL.
NINDS LEADS THE ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE RELATED DEMENTIAS AND 
WORK IN CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH 
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGES 
AND THROUGH THE CONGRESSIONAL 
PARTNERSHIP FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE 
TO FUND RESEARCH.
WE USE THE ADDED FUNDS FOR 
ACTIVITIES THAT RESPOND TO THE 
MILESTONES IN THE NATIONAL PLAN.
THE MILESTONES THAT COME FROM 
THESE SUMMITS.
IN PARTICULAR ADDED FUNDS ARE 
USED FOR INCREASED INVESTIGATOR 
INITIATED RESEARCH AND RESEARCH 
THAT'S RESPONSIVE TO NINDS, ADRD
FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES.
THIS SLIDE IS A SUMMARY AND I 
JUST WANT TO JUMP TO THE NEXT 
SLIDE SO WE CAN MOVE FORWARD AND
GET TIME BACK.
BEFORE WE GET INTO SESSIONS I 
WANT TO GIVE YOU A QUICK GUIDE 
TO THE DRAFT RECOMMENDATIONS.
YOU CAN SEE HERE THE 
RECOMMENDATION IS AN EXAMPLE AND
YOU CAN SEE IT HAS A NUMBER AND 
PRIORITY AND THE PRIORITY THAT'S
IN THE BOX IS FOLLOWED BY TEXT 
AND THAT TEXT IS THE TOP LEVEL 
RECOMMENDATION.
SO THE DATE AT THE END IS THE 
ESTIMATED YEAR TO COMPLETE OR 
FULLY IMPLEMENT THE 
RECOMMENDATION IF IT WERE 
STARTED IN 2026.
SO THE NEXT SLIDE IS WHEN I HAND
IT OFF TO DR. POSSIN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TODAY 
AND PLEASE DO PARTICIPATE IN THE
DISCUSSION SESSIONS.
AND I THINK I'LL HAND IT OFF TO 
DR. POS SCRIN.
-- DR. POSSIN.
THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; DR. POSSIN: GOOD
MORNING I'M 
PLEASED TO KICK OFF THE ADRD 
SUMMIT.
&gt;&gt; KATE, ARE YOU GOOD?
&gt;&gt; DR. POSSIN: YES, CAN
YOU HEAR
ME OKAY?
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
I HAVE NO FINANCIAL CONFLICTS TO
REPORT.
AND WE ARE HERE TODAY FOR GOOD 
REASON.
A LARGE AND GROWING NUMBER OF 
AMERICANS HAVE DEMENTIA.
DEMENTIA AFFECTS MORE THAN 6 
MILLION AMERICANS TODAY AND 13 
MILLION ARE PROJECTED TO HAVE 
DEMENTIA BY 2060.
THE RISK FOR DEVELOPING DEMENTIA
FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE INTO OLDER 
AGE IS HIGH WITH ESTIMATES 
RANGING BETWEEN 20% TO 40%.
AS SHOWN HERE IN THE RECENT 
STUDY PUBLISHED IN NATURE AND 
MEDICINE, THE RISK IS HIGHER FOR
WOMEN, FOR BLACKS AND WHITES AND
FOR PEOPLE WITH AN APOE 4 
ALLELE, PARTICULARLY FOUR 
ALLELES BUT IT'S HIGH FOR ALL 
AMERICANS WHO LIVE INTO OLDER 
AGE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE.
AND MANY ARE UNPAID CAREGIVERS.
DEMENTIA IS EXPENSIVE AND WILL 
IMPOSE A FAST GROWING ECONOMIC 
BURDEN IN THE COMING DECADES.
USING DATA FROM THE HEALTH AND 
RETIREMENT STUDY, COLLEAGUES 
ESTIMATED ANNUAL FORMAL CARE 
COSTS, THAT IS CARE THAT'S 
PURCHASED IN THE MARKETPLACE IS 
CURRENTLY $200 BILLION PER YEAR.
THIS IS JUST IN THE UNITED 
STATES.
THESE FORMAL CARE COSTS ARE 
PROJECTED TO REACH $1.4 TRILLION
BY YEAR 2060.
IF THE COST OF INFORMAL 
CAREGIVING SUCH AS FOREGONE 
WAGES BY THE CAREGIVER THE COST 
HIGHER.
WHILE THE PROJECTIONS ARE 
ECONOMICALLY DEVASTATING THEY'RE
NOT SET IN STONE.
INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND 
SYSTEMS OF CARE COULD MITIGATE 
THIS ECONOMIC BURDEN BY 
PREVENTING OR DELAYING ONSET AND
CHANGES IN LIFE AND TREATMENTS 
THAT MODIFY THE DISEASE PROCESS 
AND SMART SYSTEMS OF CARE.
THAT SUPPORT THE PERSON LIVING 
WITH DEMENTIA AND CAREGIVERS AND
LOWER TOTAL COST AND IT WILL 
REQUIRE SMART AND EFFECTIVE 
COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION 
BETWEEN SCIENTISTS AND FEDERAL 
AGENCIES IN THE PRIVATE CENTER.
THERE HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT RECENT
BREAKTHROUGHS IN ADRD SCIENCE.
YOU HEARD OF SOME THIS MORNING 
FROM DR. KOROSHETZ.
I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF 
SUMMARIZING SOME OF THE 
BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE AREA OF 
PREVENTION, DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT
AND CARE.
WE CAN PREVENT DATA THROUGH 
LIFESTYLE AND THERE'S EVIDENCE 
UNTREATED VISION LOSS AND HIGH 
HDL CHOLESTEROL ARE RISK FACTORS
FOR DEMENTIA.
THESE IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS 
COMBINED WITH THOSE THEY 
MODELLED PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNT FOR 
45% OF DEMENTIA RISK.
WE'VE ALSO LEARNED ADDRESSING 
MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS IN 
AT-RISK INDIVIDUALS CAN SLOW OR 
PREVENT COGNITIVE DECLINE.
AGGRESSIVE BLOOD PRESSURE 
MANAGEMENT REDUCES MILD 
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT RISK.
IN THE FINGERS TRIAL, AN 
INTERVENTION THAT TARGETED DIET,
EXERCISE, COGNITIVE AND SOCIAL 
STIMULATION AND VASCULAR RISK 
MONITORING IN AT-RISK 
INDIVIDUALS HAD SIGNIFICANT 
IMPROVEMENTS IN COGNITIVE 
FUNCTION.
THE U.S. POINTER IS EXTENDING 
THE WORK BY TESTING A 
POTENTIALLY SCALABLE 
INTERVENTION IN A LARGE GROUP OF
AMERICANS ACROSS THE UNITED 
STATES.
AND TRIAL RESULTS ARE EXPECTED 
THIS YEAR.
WORLDWIDE FINGERS DEMENTIA 
TRIALS TO TEST STRATEGIES ACROSS
DIVERSE POPULATIONS.
BREAKTHROUGH NUMBER TWO, WE CAN 
IDENTIFY DISEASE IN LIVING 
PEOPLE WITH INEXPENSIVE AND 
NON-INVASIVE TESTS.
PREVIOUSLY, WE COULD ONLY 
IDENTIFY ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IN 
LIVING PEOPLE USING EXPENSIVE 
AND INVASIVE TESTS, HEAD IMAGING
AND SPINAL TAPS.
IN THE STUDIES HERE IN SWEDEN, 
WHEN THE AD PLASMA BIOMARKER TAU
217 WAS AVAILABLE, THE ACCURACY 
OF DEMENTIA SPECIALISTS SHOWN IN
BLUE AND PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS 
IN A AND B WERE IDENTIFYING 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATHOLOGY 
IMPROVED SUBSTANTIALLY TO 91%.
YOU HEARD FROM DR. KOROSHETZ HOW
SUBSTANTIAL BREAKTHROUGH BEING 
MADE IN BIOMARKERS FOR 
PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND LEWY 
BODY DEMENTIA.
ALPHA SYNUCLEIN CAN BE MEASURED 
IN BLOOD, SALIVA AND SKIN AND 
PLASMA AND OTHER SCALABLE 
BIOMARKERS EXTEND ACCESS TO 
ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS AND HAVE 
FACILITATED A MOVEMENT TOWARDS 
BIOLOGICAL STAGING OF DISEASE.
THESE ADVANCES PROVIDE 
GROUNDBREAKING NEW OPPORTUNITIES
TO IMPROVE CARE AND FIND CURES.
BUT NEXT WE NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS
STANDARDIZED DIAGNOSTIC PATHWAYS
THAT INCORPORATE THESE MARKERS 
WITH OTHER CLINICAL DATA.
WE NEED TO REDUCE VARIABILITY 
DUE TO HOW THE SAMPLES ARE 
HANDLED AND PROCESS AND ADJUST 
RESULTS BASED ON PATIENT 
COMORBIDITIES THAT IMPACT 
RESULTS.
AND THE NEXT POINT WILL BE A BIG
FOCUS OF THE SUMMIT.
WE NEED TO ADVANCE BIOMARKERS TO
THE OTHER BIOLOGICAL MARKERS OF 
ADRD INCLUDING SYNUCLEIN AND 
THERE'S A MULTI-SITE NATIONAL 
CONSORTIUM TO CONSOLIDATE AND 
IDENTIFY BIOMARKERS USED IN 
DEMENTIA CLINICAL TRIALS.
THE BIOMARKERS HAVE UNDER GONE 
INSTRUMENTAL VALIDATION AND NOW 
UNDERGOING CLINICAL VALIDATION.
BREAKTHROUGH NUMBER THREE, WE 
CAN IMPROVE DIAGNOSIS OF 
DEMENTIA IN PRIMARY CARE.
YOU HEARD A BIT OF THIS FROM 
DR. KOROSHETZ.
AND THERE'S BEEN FUNDING WHERE 
PAIR DIMES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED 
AND IMPLEMENTED IN PRIMARY CARE 
AND IMPROVED DETECTION AND 
DIAGNOSIS.
THREE LARGE PRAGMATIC CLUSTER 
TRIALS ARE UNDERWAY WITH RESULTS
EXPECTED IN 2027.
I ALSO HIGHLIGHT ON THE SLIDE 
OTHER IMPORTANT INITIATIVES WITH
THE SAME GOAL THIS IS SO 
IMPORTANT.
IF WE DON'T DETECT AND DIAGNOSIS
PEOPLE EARLY IN CARE WE CAN'T 
CHANGE CARE.
AND TWO AMYLOID THERAPIES ARE 
APPROVED FOR ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE.
WHEN WE LAST HELD THE SUMMIT IN 
2022, OUR FIELD DID NOT HAVE ANY
DISEASE MODIFYING THERAPIES TO 
OFFER PATIENTS.
NOW, TWO THERAPIES THAT TARGET 
AMYLOID ARE APPROVED FOR THE 
TREATMENT OF EARLY STAGE 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.
PATIENTS MUST BE DIAGNOSED AT 
THE EARLY STAGE TO QUALIFY.
THE DECLINE IN FUNCTION IS ABOUT
27% TO 40% SLOWER WHEN ON 
TREATMENT WHICH MEANS PATIENTS 
CAN STAY INDEPENDENT AND HOLD ON
TO WHAT MATTERS MOST TO THEM FOR
SEVERAL MONTHS LONGER THAN THEY 
COULD WITHOUT THE TREATMENT.
HOWEVER THIS TREATMENT AFFECT IS
MODEST AND THE TREATMENT POSES A
RISK AND EXTENSIVE SCREENING IS 
REQUIRED TO DETERMINE IF THE 
PATIENT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE 
TREATMENT AND MOST DO NOT 
QUALIFY.
WE NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS MORE 
EFFECTIVE AND PERSONALIZED 
TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS TAILORED 
TO EACH PATIENT'S RISKS AND 
BIOMARKERS AND PROGRESS IS BEING
MADE AND TAU THERAPIES IS 
EXCITING AND TAU AGGREGATION IS 
MORE LINKED TO COGNITIVE 
DECLINE.
PROMISING GENE THERAPY APPROACH 
OR REDUCING THE IMPACT OF APOE 4
GENE AND INCREASING THE 
PROTECTIVE VARIANT AND REDUCING 
THE PRODUCTION OF AMYLOID BETA.
WE KNOW THERE'S MULTIPLE 
PATHOLOGIES IN MOST PATIENTS AND
WE'LL BE MOVING TOWARDS 
COMBINATION THERAPIES.
IN SUMMARY, TO THE TREATMENT 
AFFECT OF THE ANTIAMYLOID 
THERAPIES IS MODEST BUT 
REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT STEP 
FORWARD AND WE MUST KEEP OUR 
FOOT ON THE GAS TO HAVE MORE 
TREATMENTS AVAILABLE FOR 
PRECISION TREATMENT OF ADRD.
NIH FUNDS A WIDE RANGE OF 
CLINICAL TRIALS FOCUSSED ON THE 
TREATMENT OF ADRD.
THERE'S BEEN A SHIFT FROM 36% OF
CLINICAL TRIALS WITH 
PHARMACOLOGIC AGENTS TARGETING 
AMYLOID IN 2013 TO 2023, 15%.
ALSO YOU CAN SEE THERE'S BEEN 
SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN WILL 
NON-PHARMACOLOGIC APPROACHES.
BREAKTHROUGH NUMBER 5, WE HAVE 
DEMENTIA CARE THAT ADDRESSES 
PATIENT AND CAREGIVER NEEDS.
MEDICARE'S GUIDE PAYMENT MODEL 
RELEASED IN 2024 IS MEDICARE'S 
FIRST PAYMENT MODEL THAT 
INCLUDES SERVICES AND SUPPORTS 
FOR THE CAREGIVER.
A TRUE BREAKTHROUGH.
THERE'S A COLLABORATIVE CARE 
MODEL SPECIFICALLY DESIGN FOR 
DEMENTIA.
YOU SEE IN THE INFOGRAPHIC FROM 
CMS THE REQUIRED COMPONENTS AND 
WHEN DEMENTIA CARE ADDRESSES NOT
ONLY THE MEDICAL AND SOCIAL 
NEEDS OF THE PATIENT BUT ALSO 
THE SUPPORTS THE CAREGIVER, IT 
IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE
PATIENT, REDUCES BURDEN ON THE 
CAREGIVERS AND SAVES MEDICARE 
MONEY BY PREVENTING UNNECESSARY 
EMERGENCIES.
WITH COLLABORATIVE CARE FAMILIES
SHIFT TOWARDS A MORE PROACTIVE 
AND STABLE EXPERIENCE OF 
DEMENTIA.
THIS BREAKTHROUGH HAS BEEN MADE 
POSSIBLE BY EFFECTIVE 
COORDINATION BETWEEN 
RESEARCHERS, POLICY LEADERS AND 
FEDERAL AGENCIES.
STILL, MUCH MORE WORK REMAINS TO
OPTIMIZE AND WIDELY IMPLEMENT 
QUALITY DEMENTIA CARE AND THE 
MECHANISMS OF ITS EFFECTIVENESS.
YOU'LL HEAR MORE IN THE NEXT 
SESSION TODAY.
SO NOW I WILL BRIEFLY SHARE WITH
YOU THE TOP PRIORITY 
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM EACH OF THE
SESSIONS.
STARTING WITH SESSIONS ON THREE 
CATEGORIES OF DISEASE.
FRONTAL TEMPORAL DEMENTIA, 
VASCULAR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT 
AND LEWY BODY.
TO HELP KEEP US ON TIME I WON'T 
READ THESE TO YOU AND URGE YOU 
TO SNAP A PICTURE.
THESE ARE THE TOP 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND TWO THAT ARE
TOP PRIORITY AND THE SESSION IS 
LED BY DR. KARCH AND IRWIN.
THEY'LL BE PRESENTING LATER 
TODAY.
VASCULAR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT 
AND DEMENTIA.
THIS SESSION LED BY DR. BASATI 
AND DR. LU.
NEXT, OUR SESSION ON LEWY BODY 
DISEASE ALSO HAS TWO PRIORITY 1 
RECOMMENDATIONS LED BY DR
DR. GALVIN AND POSTIN.
NEXT, WE HAVE THREE SESSIONS ON 
SPECIAL TOPICS AND POST DBI AND 
THESE ARE SESSIONS THAT WERE 
FIRST INTRODUCED IN 2019 AND 
CONTINUE TO BE FEATURED AT THE 
SUMMIT.
THEY EACH HAVE FOUR 
RECOMMENDAT
RECOMMENDATIONS.
AND THEN A SESSION ON THE 
EXPOSOME.
THIS HAS EVOLVED SINCE 2022.
WE HAD A SESSION POST-COVID.
DR. LOOKIN AND KIPNIS ARE THE 
CHAIRS.
WE ALSO HAVE THREE SESSIONS ON 
CROSS-CUTTING THEMES.
WE HAVE A BASIC ON BASIC AND 
CLINICAL DISCOVERY RESEARCH THAT
WILL KICK OFF OUR DAY TOMORROW.
THEY HAVE FOUR RECOMMENDA RECOM 
THIS ACAN CHAIRED BY DR. IADECOL
AND CARLSSON AND THOSE AT RISK 
LIVING WITH AD/ADRD YOU'LL HEAR 
THIS ON THE THIRD DAY CHAIRED BY
DR. GLYMOUR AND THEN THE CROSS 
CUTTING THEMES WILL BE NEXT IN 
JUST A MOMENT.
SO, I'LL JUMP IN I THINK.
WE'LL LAUNCH OUR FIRST SESSION 
OF THE ADRD SUMMIT, 2025 WITH 
THE SESSION ON MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY
DEMENTIA RESEARCH FOR 
IMPLEMENTATION OF DISCOVERIES 
INTO PRACTICE.
AND THIS IS A NEW SESSION FOR 
THE 2025 SUMMIT.
YOU'LL BE HEARING TODAY FROM MY 
CLOSE COLLEAGUES WHO WILL 
PRESENT WITH ME.
DR. WOOD WITH FROM THE AMERICAN 
ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS, 
DR. HAGERTY-LINGLER FROM THE 
UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AND 
DR. SNYDER FROM THE ALZHEIMER'S 
ASSOCIATION.
I'LL START BY SAYING AGAIN I 
HAVE NO FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES.
ALL RIGHT.
SO WE HAVE THIS NEW SESSION FOR 
THIS SUMMIT.
THIS IS CALLED RESEARCH FOR 
IMPLEMENTATION OF DISCOVERIES 
INTO PRACTICE.
THE FIRST GOAL OF THE NAPA 
NATIONAL PLAN IS TO PREVENT AND 
EFFECTIVELY TREAT AD/ADRD BY 
2025.
THIS IS A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON 
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO GET THE
BREAKTHROUGHS INTO PRACTICE TO 
BENEFIT PATIENTS, FAMILIES AND 
SYSTEMS OF CARE.
BECAUSE THE RECENT ADVANCES ARE 
NOT YET AVAILABLE TO MOST 
INDIVIDUALS AT RISK FOR OR 
LIVING WITH AD/ADRD.
SESSION 1 IS FOCUSSED ON 
IDENTIFYING KEY AREAS OF 
RESEARCH NEEDED TO CAPITALIZE ON
THE BREAKTHROUGHS AND ENSURE 
THEY REACH PATIENTS, FAMILIES, 
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND HEALTH
SYSTEMS.
WE PRESENT FOR YOUR 
CONSIDERATION FOUR 
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE 
IMPORTANT ACROSS ALL STAGES OF 
BRAIN HEALTH.
OUR PRIORITY 1 RECOMMENDATION IS
FOCUSSED ON IMPROVING DETECTION,
DIAGNOSIS AND LINKAGES TO CARE.
OUR PRIORITY 2 IS FOCUSSED ON 
IMPROVING ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE
WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT 
AROUND THE DIAGNOSIS AND INITIAL
TREATMENT PERIOD.
OUR PRIORITY 3 RECOMMENDATION IS
ON DEMENTIA CARE AND PRIORITY 4 
IS ON PRIMARY AND SECONDARY 
PREVENTION.
MOST THE RESEARCH THAT WE'RE 
RECOMMENDING USES THE METHODS OF
IMPLEMENTATION AND DISSEMINATION
SCIENCE WITH THE GOAL TO IMPROVE
PATIENT OUTCOMES AND ENHANCE 
CARE QUALITY.
THIS TYPE OF RESEARCH IS BEST 
CONDUCTED AS A COLLABORATION 
BETWEEN SCIENTISTS AND 
PRACTITIONERS WITH 
BI-DIRECTIONAL LEARNING 
THROUGHOUT THE INTEGRATION 
PROCESS.
PRIMARY CARE PLAYS A CRUCIAL 
ROLE IN THE RESEARCH RECOMMENDED
BY THE SESSION.
MOST PCPs FEEL THEY'RE IN THE 
FRONT LINES OF PROVIDING 
DEMENTIA CARE YET NOT PREPARED 
TO PROVIDE THIS CARE.
I WANT TO THANK MY INCREDIBLE 
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WORKING WITH 
ME TO PREPARE THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS WE PRESENT TODAY
FOR YOUR INPUT.
I'LL PRESENT NOW OUR 
RECOMMENDATION ON CARE.
WE RECOMMEND TO CONDUCT RESEARCH
TO ENHANCE THE EFFICIENCY AND 
EFFECTIVENESS OF EVIDENCE-BASED 
AND EVIDENCE-INFORMED 
COLLABORATIVE CARE MODELS THAT 
SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS 
AND CARE PARTNERS AT KEY POINTS 
IN THE AD/ADRD CARE JOURNEY FROM
DIAGNOSIS TO END OF LIFE 
INCLUDING POPULATIONS MOST AT 
RISK FOR POORER OUTCOMES.
AND A PATIENT SAID HIS HEART 
DISEASE WAS TOUGH BUT THINGS 
REALLY FELL A PART WHEN HIS 
MEMORY STARTED TO GO AND I FELT 
STUM IN HIS ENDLESS CYCLE ER 
VISITS AND HOSPITAL STAYS AND I 
WAS EXHAUSTED TRYING TO FIGURE 
IT OUT ON MY OWN WITH NO ONE 
HELPING ME FIGURE IT OUT.
I FELT ALONE JUST TRYING TO KEEP
MY DAD SAFE.
THIS SESSION'S RECOMMENDATION ON
CARE IS FOCUSSED ON 
COLLABORATIVE CARE FOR DEMENTIA 
THIS USES MULTI-DISCIPLINARY 
NEEDS TO MEET THE PSYCHOSOCIAL 
NEEDS AND EMPHASIZES CARE 
NAVIGATION AND SUPPORT.
THIS TYPE OF CARE HAS BEEN SHOWN
TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR 
PEOPLE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA, 
CAREGIVER WELL BEING AND REDUCED
EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT AND REDUCED
TOTAL COST OF CARE AND REDUCING 
POLY PHARMACY.
THERE'S BEEN SUBSTANTIAL HARD 
WORK AND PROGRESS TOWARDS BETTER
DEMENTIA QUAR  -- CARE FOR ALL.
AND THERE WERE COLLABORATIVE 
DEMENTIA CARE MODELS.
THE 2019 ADRD SUMMIT INTRODUCED 
A RECOMMENDATION FOR ADVANCED 
DEMENTIA CARE AND NIH 
SUBMISSIONED REVIEWS TO EVALUATE
THE DEMENTIA CARE AND THE 
RESULTING WHITE PAPERS CONCLUDE 
THE EVIDENCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO 
IMPLEMENT COLLABORATIVE CARE 
MODELS IN WITH EVALUATION 
CONDUCTED TO CONTINUE EXPANDING 
THE EVIDENCE BASE.
THIS INSPIRED IMPORTANT POLICY 
WORK BY THE ALZHEIMER'S 
ASSOCIATION AND IMPACT MOVEMENT 
AND OTHERS WHICH LED TO THE 
COMPREHENSIVE CARE FOR 
ALZHEIMER'S ACT.
INTRODUCED IN THE HOUSE AND 
SENATE WITH STRONG BUY  -- 
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND WE HAVE 
THE MODEL AND THIS BRINGS US TO 
THE ADRD SUMMIT OF 2025 WHERE WE
RECOMMEND THE NEXT CRUCIAL STEPS
IN RESEARCH TO MOVE US TOWARDS 
BETTER DEMENTIA CARE FOR ALL.
THE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS TOWARDS
BETTER DEMENTIA CARE REFLECTS 
EFFECTIVE COORDINATION BETWEEN 
FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH, 
POLICY WORK, FEDERAL AGENCIES 
AND BIPARTISAN LEGISLATORS BUT 
WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO.
CHALLENGES REMAIN.
THE EFFECT SIZES ARE SMALL AND 
SOME TRIALS HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE.
AFFECT SIZES CAN VARY 
SUBSTANTIALLY FROM DIFFERENT 
TYPES OF PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS
WHICH MAY HELP EXPLAIN THE SMALL
EFFECT SIZES WITHIN AND ACROSS 
STUDIES.
WE NEED TO &#x2588;DO A BETTER JOB 
UNDERSTANDING THE RIGHT CARE FOR
THE RIGHT PATIENT AT THE RIGHT 
TIME AND NEED TO ADAPT CARE 
MODELS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF 
PATIENTS WHO LIVE ALONE OR 
WITHOUT AN ENGAGED CAREGIVER.
THE CARE MODELS TEND TO HAVE 
MANY COMPONENTS OF CARE JUST 
LIKE GUIDE BUT WE DON'T ALWAYS 
KNOW WHICH ARE THE COMPONENTS 
THAT DRIVE EFFECTIVENESS.
WE NEED TO ADAPT OUR CARE MODELS
TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS 
DURING VULNERABLE POINTS IN 
THEIR JOURNEY AND CARE TEAMS 
IMPLEMENTING SCIENCE-BASED CARE 
MODEL FACING CHALLENGES 
INFIDELITY AND INTEGRATING THE 
MODELS WITH ROUTINE CARE.
THIS COULD BE ADDRESSED IN PART 
WITH A.I.-BASED TOOLS.
SO, THIS IS THE FULL TEXT OF 
THIS RECOMMENDATION.
WE WANT TO PUSH FORWARD RESEARCH
THAT ADDRESSES VULNERABLE POINTS
IN THE CARE JOURNEY.
WE WANT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF 
INDIVIDUALS IN THE HETEROGENEOUS
POPULATION INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO 
LIVE ALONE.
IN COOPERATE DECISION SUPPORT 
TOOLS, GENERATIVE A.I. 
APPROACHES TO DRIVE EFFICIENCIES
AND ADHERE TO BEST PRACTICES.
IDENTIFY THE CORE COMPONENTS OF 
CARE THAT DRIVE EFFECTIVENESS 
AND FOR WHOM.
AND ADVANCE WORK ON THE 
AVAILABILITY OF COMMON DATA 
ELEMENTS TO FACILITATE 
EVALUATION OF REAL-WORLD 
SETTINGS.
THANK YOU AND NEXT.
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE NOW JULIE 
WOOD WHO WILL SPEAK ON OUR NEXT 
RECOMMENDATION.
&gt;&gt; JULIE WOOD: THANK YOU
FOR 
JOINING US.
I'M JULIE WOOD A FAMILY 
PHYSICIAN AND JOINING FROM THE 
AMERICAN ACADEMY OF FAMILY 
PHYSICIANS THAT REPRESENTED 
ABOUT 28,000 FAMILY PHYSICIANS 
FROM ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.
MY -- I'M GOING TO COVER 
PRIORITY 1 A RECOMMENDATION ON 
DIAGNOSIS.
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO 
DISCLOSE.
I'M GOING TO READ THIS FOR YOU 
AS WELL.
OUR RECOMMENDATION ON DIAGNOSIS,
CONDUCT IMPLEMENTATION AND 
DISSEMINATION RESEARCH ON 
EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS TO 
DETECT AND DIAGNOSIS COGNITIVE, 
BEHAVIORAL OR FUNCTIONAL 
IMPAIRMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH 
AD/ADRD, COMMUNICATE RESULTS TO 
PATIENTS AND CARE PARTNERS AND 
LINK THEM TO QUALITY CARE IN 
PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTINGS.
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE 
WANTED TO EMPHASIZE IS WHY THIS 
IS SO IMPORTANT TO DIAGNOSIS 
MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT.
OFTEN THIS CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT 
WE CAN HELP TREAT SOMETHING 
THAT'S REVERSIBLE.
THIS MAY BE A CONDITION WHERE WE
TREAT SOMETHING LIKE A MEDICAL 
PROBLEM THAT IS ACTUALLY A 
REVERSIBLE PROBLEM.
WE CAN ALSO OPTIMIZE MEDICATION.
THIS CAN HELP INFORM TREATMENT 
DECISIONS FOR OTHER CONDITIONS 
THAT A PERSON MAY HAVE.
WE ALSO WANT TO HELP CONNECT 
PEOPLE TO OTHER SERVICES AS WELL
AS THE CAREGIVERS AND THIS IS 
MUCH OF WHAT THE GUIDE MODEL IS 
BASED ON YOU HEARD ABOUT 
EARLIER.
IT GIVES A PATIENT AND THEIR 
FAMILY THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE 
DECISIONS ABOUT PARTICIPATING IN
CLINICAL TRIALS OR OTHER 
RESEARCH THAT'S AVAILABLE.
AND A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE IS 
STARTING TO TALK ABOUT QUALITY 
OF LIFE AND GOALS FOR THE 
PATIENT AND THEIR FAMILY.
AND TALK ABOUT SAFETY ISSUES.
AND TALK TO THE PATIENT AND 
THEIR FAMILY ABOUT PLANNING 
AHEAD FOR THEIR CARE AND HAVING 
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT ARE THE
GOALS.
IMPORTANTLY, TALKING ESPECIALLY 
NOW AS YOU HEARD EARLIER TALKING
ABOUT NEW AND EMERGING 
THERAPIES.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE METHODS 
IN PLACE TO FIND PEOPLE EARLIER 
TO HELP WITH THE INTERVENTIONS 
THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT.
THERE'S ALSO DISPARITIES IN 
MEDICALLY UNDER SERVED 
COMMUNITIES AND MINORITIES, 
PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS LIKE WHERE
I PRACTICE AND DIFFERENT SOCIAL 
DISADVANTAGES AND WE KNOW THE 
DIFFERENT RESOURCES ON THE SLIDE
BELOW.
SO IN PRIMARY CARE THERE'S A LOT
OF BARRIERS.
THERE'S A DEFINITE INTEREST 
AMONG PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN TO 
DO THIS BUT IT COULD BE A BIT 
OVERWHELMING.
TIME WAS GIVEN AS THE TOP 
FACTOR.
THERE WAS AN INTEREST AND A 
KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEED AND AS YOU
HEARD EARLIER FROM THE PREVIOUS 
PRESENTATION 82% OF PRIMARY CARE
DOCS CONSIDER THEMSELVES THE 
FRONT LINE.
HOWEVER, AN ALMOST EQUAL CONCERN
AND BARRIER.
ONE THING WE WANTED TO POINT OUT
IS THERE WAS A STUDY DONE BY THE
JOURNAL OF INTERNAL MEDICINE, 
GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE THAT 
CAME OUT IN 2022 THAT LOOKED AT 
TIME AND THEY ACTUALLY FOUND OUT
IF PRIMARY DOCS DID EVERYTHING 
RECOMMENDED IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR
ALL KINDS OF GUIDELINES IT WOULD
TAKE A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN 
26.7 HOURS A DAY TO DO ALL 
THOSE.
WE WANT TO DO ALL THOSE AND 
PROVIDE GOOD CARE BUT THE KEY IS
WE HAVE TO FIND GOOD WAYS TO DO 
THAT AND HAVE THE RIGHT CARE AT 
THE RIGHT TIME SO WE CAN WORK IN
TEAMS AND A LOT OF OUR 
RECOMMENDATIONS TODAY ARE BASED 
ON THAT.
WE ALSO FOUND WITH SURVEYS 
INCLUDING ONE FROM MY 
ORGANIZATION AND -- 
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A TWO-MINUTE 
WARNING.
&gt;&gt; JULIE WOOD: THAT
GETTING 
CONFIDENCE IN TRAINING IS THE 
MOST IMPORTANT THING TO THEM AND
REDISCOVERED ORGANIZATIONS 
GETTING INFORMATION ON 
EVIDENCE-BASED CARE WAS KEY.
WE RECOMMEND TO GO WITH 
COGNITIVE SCREENING.
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF FACTORS 
THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO 
RISK-BASED SCREENING AND 
COGNITIVE CARE IN PRIMARY CARE 
CLINICS THAT CAN ALLOW IT TO GO 
MUCH QUICKER.
THE NEXT SLIDE IS A DIAGRAM THAT
WAS DONE AT A CONFERENCE OF 
MULTI-DISCIPLINARY SCIENTISTS ON
HOW THE RISK STRATIFICATION CAN 
OCCUR OFFSITE AND BUILD INTO THE
WELLNESS VISIT.
I WANTED TO MENTION IT'S VERY TO
KNOW THERE'S CLINICAL TRIALS 
ONGOING AND THE MILESTONE 
SHOWING THE PARADIGMS IS VERY 
IMPORTANT AND THERE'S RESEARCH 
ON THE WAY.
YOU HEARD ABOUT ONE OF THEM.
I WON'T REITERATE THAT BECAUSE 
WE HAD A GREAT SUMMARY BEFORE.
YOU SAW THE SLIDE OF SEVERAL 
MENTIONED.
THESE ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN 
PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS FOR EARLY 
DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS.
SO, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE 
HAVING SETTINGS AND FRAGMENTED 
RESEARCH CONTINUED AND THAT'S 
OUR RECOMMENDATION.
I WILL LEAVE IT THERE FOR YOU TO
SEE AND SINCE I'M OUT OF TIME, 
THANK YOU.
I READ THE BEGINNING.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.
I'LL TURN IT OVER TO DR
DR. LINGLER.
&gt;&gt; DR. LINGLER: IT'S AN
HONOR TO
PRESENT ON BEHALF OF OUR WORKING
GROUP.
MY DISCLOSURES IS PAID 
COMPENSATION AND WE HAVE 
STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO 
HIGH QUALITY AD/ADRD CARE 
INCLUDING DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATIONS
AND BIOMARKER TESTING, 
PHARMACOLOGIC AND 
NON-PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENTS AND
PALLIATIVE CARE AND HOSPICE 
CARE.
RECOGNIZING THE EARLIEST PROCESS
INCLUDES STRATEGY TO INCREASE BE
OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRAIN HEALTH 
RESEARCH PARTICIPATION.
THE ACCESS RECOMMENDATION IS NEW
THIS YEAR.
IT'S GROUNDED IN A ROBUST BODY 
OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTING MANY 
BREAKTHROUGHS HIGHLIGHTED 
THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION ARE NOT
BENEFITING ALL FAMILIES IMPACTED
BY DEMENTIAS.
I'LL PROVIDE THE RATIONALE FOR 
THE RECOMMENDATION.
BEAR IN MIND THE RECOMMENDATION 
IS COMPREHENSIVE IN SCOPE 
SPANNING THE DIAGNOSTIC AND CARE
CONTINUUM SO VIEW THIS AS A HIGH
LEVEL OVERVIEW FOR CHALLENGES TO
HIGH QUALITY CARE ALONG A 
PERSON'S DEMENTIA TRAJECTORY.
A RECENT SYNTHESIS OF PUBLISHED 
LITERATURE SHOWS A PATTERN THAT 
THOSE WHO ARE FROM GROUPS NOBODY
TO EXPERIENCE MORE AD/ADRD TURN 
OUT TO BE THE LEAST LIKELY TO 
RECEIVE TIMELY AND ACCURATE 
DIAGNOSIS AND RECEIVE TREATMENT 
WITH INHIBITERS AS THE DISEASE 
PROGRESSES THE PATTERNS OF LOWER
QUALITY CARE PERSIST OFTEN IN 
THE FORMS OF CARE.
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE 
PATTERNS BEGINNING WITH 
DIAGNOSTICS.
YOU HEARD THE DIAGNOSES OF 
AD/ADRD.
ON THE PANEL TO YOUR LEFT WE 
HIGHLIGHT CLAIMS DATA 
DEMONSTRATING MISSES AND DEVIL 
RAYS IN DEMENTIA DIAGNOSES ARE 
PROGRAMATIC WITH DELAYS FOR 
HISPANIC INDIVIDUALS AND LONGER 
FOR THOSE IN THE HISPANIC AND 
NON-HISPANIC GROUPS.
A STUDY DOCUMENTED HIGHER 
PREVALENCE OF AD/ADRD AMONG 
RURAL POPULATIONS BUT NOTED 
CONSISTENT DELAYED DIAGNOSIS AND
LACK OF ACCESS TO PROFESSIONALS.
AND AS WAS ALLUDED TO, THE 
IMPLICATION MATTER TODAY BUT ARE
SALIENT WHEN WE CONSIDER THE 
ELIGIBILITY WINDOW FOR NOVEL AND
EMERGING THERAPEUTICS.
AS THE FIELD MOVES FORWARD TO AN
ERA OF BIOMARKER INFORMED 
DIAGNOSIS THERE'S EARLY EVIDENCE
IN THE ABSENCE OF THE DEDICATED 
EFFORT THOSE AT HIGHEST RISK 
FROM AD/ADRD MAY BE LESS LIKELY 
TO UNDER GO BIOMARKER TESTS.
HERE THE STUDY SHOWS ACCESS TO 
AMYLOID PET WAS UNEVEN ACROSS 
RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS AND IF 
YOU PAN TO THE RIGHT, A REVIEW 
OF STUDIES ON THE TURN OF 
BIOMARKER TESTS RESULTS TO 
PATIENTS AND FAMILIES SHOWS A 
NEED OF PARTICIPANTS FROM BLACK 
AND BROWN COMMUNITIES SO IT 
INFORMS BEST PRACTICES FOR THE 
RESPONSIBLE RETURN OF THE 
SENSITIVE INFORMATION.
IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO PHARMACO 
THERAPIES IT'S ESSENTIAL TO NOTE
CARE ENCOMPASSES NOT ONLY THE 
TIMELY INITIATION OF FDA 
APPROACHED ANTI-DEMENTIA 
MEDICATIONS BUT EXTENDS TO 
INAPPROPRIATE PRESCRIBING FOR 
MOOD AND BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS AND
COMORBID SYMPTOMS.
AS HIGHLIGHTED INDIVIDUALS FROM 
RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE 
PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY THE 
LATTER.
THE LAST EXAMPLES IDENTIFY 
STRATEGY TO IMPROIF ACCESS TO 
HIGH QUALITY CARE IN THE FINAL 
STAGES OF AD/ADRD.
AS THE TEXT ON THE LEFT 
HIGHLIGHTS MEDICARE 
BENEFICIARIES IDENTIFYING AS 
BLACK AND/OR HISPANIC RECEIVE 
MORE BURDENSOME AND COSTLY CARE 
AT THE END OF LIFE.
SIMILAR TO OTHER ASPECTS OF CARE
WE SEE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE 
ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CARE FOR 
LATER STAGE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE
PUBLICATION HIGHLIGHTING LOWER 
RATES OF DOCUMENTS GOALS OF CARE
INCLUDING DEMENTIA PATIENTS 
RECEIVING HOSPICE.
IN SUM, ADVANCES IN AD/ADRD CARE
FOR DIAGNOSTIC PRECISION TO END 
OF LIFE CARE HAVE NOT BENEFITTED
ALL WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THE 
CONDITIONS IT'S CRITICAL TO 
ACCELERATING THE TRANSITION OF 
EFFECTIVE DIAGNOSIS OF CARE AND 
REACHING REACH THOSE WITH WHO 
EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST BURDEN 
OF AD/ADRD.
THE WORK GROUP RECOMMEND TO 
IDENTIFY AND NAVIGATE PEOPLE TO 
QUALITY CARE WITH A FOCUS ON 
POPULATIONS EXPERIENCING HEALTH 
DISPARITIES.
THESE INTERVENTIONS SHOULD TAKE 
A SYSTEMS APPROACH AND 
APPROACHES SHOULD INCORPORATE 
PROVIDER EDUCATION AND TRAINING 
AND LINK PATIENTS WITH THE CARE 
THAT'S RIGHT FOR THEM.
AND LASTLY TO EXAMINE ETHICAL 
ISSUES AND EVALUATE PATHWAYS IN 
EVERYDAY CLINICAL SETTINGS AND 
SHOULD INCLUDE HELPING PROVIDERS
TO INTERPRET AND COMMUNICATE THE
RESULTS IN A WAY THAT OPTIMIZE 
AGENCY AND REDUCES POTENTIAL 
HARM.
WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO 
DR. SNYDER AND LOOK FORWARD TO 
THE DISCUSSION.
&gt;&gt; DR. SNYDER: GOOD
MORNING, 
EVERYBODY.
I'M TRYING TO TURN ON MY CAMERA 
AND IT'S NOT LETTING ME SO I'LL 
KEEP GOING AND HOPEFULLY 
SOMEBODY CAN FIGURE THAT OUT.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO PRESENT ON 
BEHALF OF THE WORK GROUP AS WE 
THINK ABOUT THE FOURTH 
RECOMMENDATION.
AND THESE ARE MY DISCLOSURES.
AS WE GET TO BACK TO MIXED 
ETIOLOGY DEMENTIA THE PRIMARY 
AND SECONDARY PREVENTION IT'S 
ABOUT THE PREVENTION OF 
COGNITIVE DECLINE OR THE 
CONTINUED DECLINE OF AN 
INDIVIDUAL ONCE THEY'RE 
EXPERIENCING COGNITIVE CHANGES 
FOR THEMSELVES.
IN THINKING ABOUT PREVENTION, 
THIS GETS YOU TO OUR NEXT SLIDE 
RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS TO 
EVALUATE THE IMPLEMENTATION 
EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERVENTIONS 
THAT MITIGATE THE RISK OF 
COGNITIVE DECLINE IN PRIMARY 
CARE AND COMMUNITY SETTINGS.
THE IDEA OF ACCESS WITH A STRONG
FOCUS ON POPULATIONS 
EXPERIENCING DISPROPORTIONATE 
AD/ADRD BURDEN.
SO THE WORK GROUP TALKED ABOUT 
THE POTENTIAL AND EXAMPLES OF 
HOW IN PARTICULAR PRIMARY CARE 
COULD BE IMPLEMENTED.
THE IDEA AS WE THINK ABOUT THE 
NEED FOR RESEARCH THAT FOCUSES 
ON IMPLEMENTATION, STRATEGIES, 
PERSONALIZED INTERVENTIONS BASED
ON THE PATIENT'S RISK AND CAN BE
DELIVERED WITHIN PRIMARY CARE 
COMMUNITY.
WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS AN EXAMPLE 
THAT CAME FROM DR. WOOD WHO 
PREVIOUSLY SPOKE FROM THE AAFP 
THINKING ABOUT ALCOHOL USE AND 
SCREENING AND CESSATION PROGRAMS
DELIVERED IN PRIMARY CARE.
IN USING A SIMPLE BASIC 
SCREENING TOOL DELIVERED 
THROUGHOUT PRIMARY CARE, YOU CAN
SEE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON BOTH
THE CONVERSATION HAPPENING IN 
PRIMARY CARE, AWARENESS OF THE 
THIS AS A POTENTIAL ISSUE AND A 
CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR.
AGAIN, REALLY LEADING TO IF WE 
CAN HAVE THE KINDS OF 
CONVERSATIONS AS IT APPLIES TO 
COGNITIVE DECLINE AND WE CAN 
IDENTIFY THE PRACTICES OR 
INTERVENTIONS FOR DELAYING OR 
SLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL'S RISK OF 
COGNITIVE DECLINE, THEN THIS MAY
ALLOW US TO MOVE FORWARD AND 
THINKING OF THE IDEA OF PRIMARY 
OR SECONDARY PREVENTION IN THE 
PRIMARY CARE OR IN THE 
COMMUNITY.
SO WE LOOK AT PHYSICIANS OR 
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS, ONE OF 
THE THINGS WE HEAR AND THIS CAM 
CAME FROM THE ALZHEIMER'S 
ASSOCIATION S AND FIGURES IN 
2020, 71% PHYSICIANS SAY THEY'RE
ASKED ONCE A WEEK ABOUT DEMENTIA
AND IN THINKING ABOUT TOOLS AND 
IDENTIFYING WHERE AND WHEN WE 
MAY BE ABLE TO INTERVENE WE NEED
TO THINK ABOUT PREPARING OR 
SUPPORTING THESE CONVERSATIONS 
WITH INFORMATION, ACCURATE 
INFORMATION AND GOING INTO THE 
PRIOR THREE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IN THINKING 
ABOUT TREATMENT AND THINKING 
ABOUT DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS IN
THE FACTS AND FIGURES REPORT 
PUBLISHED TODAY, 68% OF 
INDIVIDUALS TALK ABOUT THEIR 
DESIRE TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION 
IN THINKING ABOUT MAKING 
BEHAVIORAL CHANGES.
85% THAT OF INDIVIDUALS FIRST 
DIAGNOSED BY NON-DEMENTIA 
SPECIAL 
&gt;&gt; USISTS AND THEY THE 
INITIAL DEMENTIA DIAGNOSIS.
85% OF PERSONS DIAGNOSED WERE 
WERE DIAGNOSED BY A NON-DEMENTIA
SPECIALIST AND EVEN AFTER FIVE 
YEARS AROUND 23.5% OF 
BENEFICIARIES HAD A DIAGNOSIS OF
AN UNSPECIFIED DEMENTIA AND 
LOWER WITH THOSE WHO RECEIVED 
DEMENTIA SPECIALIST HEALTH CARE 
AND OVER FIVE YEARS LESS THAN 
HALF OF ALL PERSONS WITH 
DEMENTIA RECEIVED AN AD 
DIAGNOSIS.
AGAIN, IDENTIFYING THAT THROUGH 
PRIMARY CARE AND THERE'S A PATH 
IN THINKING ABOUT PRIMARY AND 
SECONDARY PREVENTION.
DR. POSSIN TALKED ABOUT THE 
LANCET COMMISSION REPORT IN 
THINKING ABOUT THE DEMENTIA RISK
AS A CONSOLATION OF ACCUMULATORS
ACROSS A PERSON'S LIFE AND BY 
UNDERSTANDING THAT THROUGH THE 
POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTORS TO A 
PERSON'S RISK, THIS CAN AID IN 
THE CONVERSATION WITH THE HEALTH
CARE PROVIDER.
AND AS WE THINK OF BUILDING OUT 
THE CONVERSATIONS AND TOOLS AND 
TESTS AND STUDIES THAT CAN ALLOW
US TO HAVE THE INFORMATION, 
THERE'S A NEED FOR US TO 
TRANSLATE THIS TYPE OF 
INFORMATION TO TOOLS THAT WILL 
IDENTIFY THOSE MOST AT RISK FOR 
TE DISEASE OR MOST AT RISK FOR 
COGNITIVE DECLINE IN A SCALABLE 
ACCURATE WAY.
&gt;&gt; TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.
THERE'S A RESEARCH IN THINKING 
ABOUT DETECTION AND EARLY 
DETECTION IN SOME OF THESE 
EXAMPLES.
THESE ARE HIGH-LEVEL EXAMPLES.
WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT
THINKING ABOUT TAX AD AS 
EXAMPLES IN HOW TO DETECT THE 
EARLIEST CHANGES.
WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS IN THINKING
ABOUT THERE'S A NUMBER OF 
STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE IN 
DELIVERY OF SPECIFIC 
INTERVENTIONS WHETHER IT BE 
LOOKING AT EXERCISE IN A 
POPULATION OF PEOPLE THAT MAY BE
EXPERIENCING MILD COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT OR COGNITIVE TRAINING
IN INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE BOARD.
OR LOOKING AT THINGS TRYING TO 
UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING 
BIOLOGY IN AN INDIVIDUAL SO WE 
CAN EXPAND OUT THE TYPES OF 
INTERVENTIONS IN THE 
PERSONALIZED APPROACH.
OR LOOKING AT MULTIMODAL 
INTERVENTIONS LOOKING AT 
MULTIPLE RISK REDUCTION 
STRATEGIES AND THEY'RE TIED INTO
RESEARCH EFFORTS IN THINK ABOUT 
DISCOVERY VALIDATION AND 
IMPLEMENTATION ACROSS ALL THE 
SPECTRUMS OF DISCOVERY AND 
INTERVENTION IN CLINICAL CARE 
THAT CAN BE DELIVERED THROUGH 
PRIMARY CARE.
AND SO THINKING ABOUT THE 
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS OF OUR 
WORK GROUP AND EVALUATING THE 
IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS
OF INTERVENTIONS THAT PROMOTE 
BRAIN HEALTH AND MITIGATE THE 
RISK OF PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS 
WITH A STRONG FOCUS ON 
POPULATIONS EXPERIENCING 
DISPROPORTIONATE AD/ADRD BURDEN 
AND TOOLS TO IDENTIFY HIGH RISK 
INDIVIDUALS AND THINKING OF 
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY 
INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE LOOKING 
AT THOSE DIFFERENT FACTORS, 
THINKING ABOUT PROMOTING BRAIN 
HEALTH, REDUCING RISK OF 
COGNITIVE DECLINE AND 
INTERVENTIONS THAT MAY INCLUDE 
GUIDANCE ON PERSONALIZED 
INTERVENTION STRATEGIES BASED ON
A PATIENT'S RISK PROFILE.
SO THIS BRINGS US TO THE SECTION
CLOSE WHERE WE'VE GONE THROUGH 
THE FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT 
YOU SEE LISTED HERE.
WHETHER WE'RE THINKING ABOUT 
THAT ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF 
IMPLEMENTATION AND DISSEMINATION
RESEARCH ON EVIDENCE-BASED 
INTERVENTIONS TO DETECT AND 
DIAGNOSIS COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT 
AND THINKING ABOUT EVALUATION 
STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO 
CARE PATIENTS AND PARTNERS TO 
QUALITY CARE.
THINKING OF CONDUCTING RESEARCH 
FOR THE ADVOCACY AND 
EFFECTIVENESS OF EVIDENCE-BASED 
RESEARCH AND THINKING ABOUT THE 
OPPORTUNITY FOR PRIMARY AND 
SECONDARY PREVENTION AS WE GO 
FORWARD.
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'LL 
TURN IT BACK TO THE SESSION 
CHAIR.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.
I WANT TO THANK THE PRESENTERS.
I ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE 
COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WORKED 
TOGETHER FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS
AND INVITE THEM ALL TO TURN ON 
THEIR CAMERAS THEY'RE ABLE TO 
JOIN US TODAY.
WE ARE VERY EAGER TO HEAR 
COMMENT.
SO, I THINK YOU CAN USE THE 
RAISE HAND FEATURE IF YOU'D LIKE
TO SHARE A COMMENT OR QUESTION 
FOR THE PANELISTS.
I SEE THE FIRST HAND IS RAISED.
PLEASE TURN ON YOUR CAMERA IF 
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE AND TELL US 
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.
&gt;&gt; ANYONE WHO WANTS TO ASK
A 
QUESTION USE THE RAISE HAND 
FEATURE.
SO ENABLE YOUR CAMERA AND 
MICROPHONE AND THEN YOU CAN TURN
IT OFF.
WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE NAMES.
I'M GOING TO TRY TO COME BACK TO
THIS.
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU HEAR ME?
&gt;&gt; YES.
THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HI.
THANKS FOR THE VERY INTERESTING 
PRESENTATIONS IT MAY BE NAIVE TO
THINK WE CAN DISCUSS POLITICIANS
AND DO YOU THINK IT WILL AFFECT 
AND SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE SEEN 
AS A DEI EFFORT SO CAN YOU 
COMMENT ON HOW POLITICS CAN 
AFFECT SOME MUCH THESE?
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THAT VERY
IMPORTANT QUESTION.
I THINK DR. KOROSHETZ MAY BE 
ABLE TO SPEAK THAT.
&gt;&gt; DR. KOROSHETZ: DEMENTIA
IS A 
POLITICAL PROBLEM.
LET'S GET THAT ON THE TABLE 
FIRST.
HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE PROGRAMS 
THAT EVERYONE, HEALTH CARE AND 
EVERYONE HAS TO WRESTLE WITH.
HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE NOT 
INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNMENT'S DEI
ADMINISTRATIONS AT THE CURRENT 
TIME.
ALL INDICATIONS TALKING TO THE 
NIH DIRECTOR WHO HAS MADE IT 
VERY CLEAR, HEALTH DISPARITIES 
AND DEI ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
ISSUES ACCORDING TO THE 
ADMINISTRATION'S DEFINITION.
WE REALLY DO NEED TO RECOGNIZE 
AND MORE THAN RECOGNIZE, DEVELOP
INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL REDUCE 
HEALTH DISPARITIES WITH REGARD 
TO DEMENTIA AND DEMENTIA CARE IN
THE U.S. AND THAT'S REALLY 
IMPORTANT FOR THE SUMMIT.
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ON JUNE 2 
PARTICULARLY ON THE ISSUE.
VERY IMPORTANT.
I'M GLAD TO GET THAT CLEARED UP.
&gt;&gt; SORRY TO PUSH FOR THE 
FOLLOW-UP CAN I ASKED ABOUT THE 
PROPOSED 44% DECREASE IN NIH 
BUDGET FOR NEXT YEAR.
DO YOU THINK IT'S LIKELY TO 
AFFECT NIA AND NINDS?
&gt;&gt; DR. KOROSHETZ: THE
BUDGETS 
COME OUT IN DIFFERENT STAGES AND
GET WORKED ON BY THE SENATE AND 
HOUSE.
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE 
BUDGET'S GOING TO BE.
SO, WE CAN'T REALLY COMMENT 
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
BUDGET IS.
&gt;&gt; SHOULD WE TRY AGAIN?
AFTER THAT WE'LL SEE DALE 
LESINA.
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A BLOCK 
SIGN.
LET'S GO FORWARD WITH DALE FOR 
NOW.
DALE, PLEASE, SHARE YOUR 
COMMENTS.
WE CAN'T QUITE HEAR YOU YET.
ARE YOU ABLE STO  -- TO UNMUTE?
WE CAN SEE YOU.
WE CAN'T HEAR YOU YET.
ARE YOU ABLE TO UNMUTE?
NO, CAN'T UNMUTE.
I WISH WE COULD HEAR YOUR 
COMMENT.
HMM.
WHILE THE TEAM IS TROUBLE 
SHOOTING LET'S SEE IF ANOTHER 
PERSON CAN UNMUTE.
WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU DALE.
HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIX THIS.
ERIC, I THINK ALSO NOT ABLE TO.
WE'LL TRY ONE MORE PERSON 
OTHERWISE THIS SEEMS TO BE A 
PROBLEM ON OUR END.
&gt;&gt; I THINK SO.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
&gt;&gt; YES.
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; DR. KOROSHETZ:  PENNY,
HOW 
DID YOU DO THAT?
&gt;&gt; MAGIC.
I THINK SOMEONE ENABLED IT 
BECAUSE IT WASN'T POSSIBLE FOR 
ME AND SEEMS TO BE FINE SOMEONE 
ON YOUR I.T. SIDE ENABLED IT BUT
I THINK THE PEOPLE HERE HAVE 
BEEN TRYING SO I CAN'T ANSWER 
THAT FOR YOU, WALTER.
I WILL COMMENT ON A QUESTION.
NUMBER ONE, THANK YOU TO ALL OF 
YOU FOR YOUR EXCEPTIONAL WORK 
AND I WANT TO THANK THE NIH AND 
ALL THE ACADEMIC RESEARCH 
LEADERS WHO ARE BEHIND THE 
BREAKTHRO
BREAKTHROUGHS THAT BROUGHT OUT 
TO THE CONVERSATION TO HOW TO 
ACCESS AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE WITH 
PARKINSON'S DISEASE THAT DEVELOP
LEWY BODY DISEASE AND DISORDERS 
ACTUALLY FTD INITIALLY DIAGNOSED
WITHIN THE PARKINSON CLINICS.
WE HAVE THE VARIANT FORMS THAT 
MAY NOT MANIFEST IN THE SAME 
WAY.
IN THE WORK YOUR RECOMMENDING 
AND HOW TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO 
DIAGNOSIS, CAN YOU TALK ABOUT 
HOW TO INCORPORATE THAT 
COMPLEXITY PEOPLE CAN BE SHOWING
UP WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF 
SYMPTOMS, IT'S NOT ALWAYS 
MODERATE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT.
HOW DO WE GET BETTER ACCESS TO 
EVERYBODY FACING ONE OF THE 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE OR 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE RELATED 
DEMENTIAS?
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, PENNY, FOR
THAT.
I'LL GIVE A BRIEF ANSWER AND IF 
ANYBODY ELSE WANTS TO SPEAK, I 
WANT TO SAY WE'RE NOTING THIS 
DOWN AND CAN MAKE SURE OUR 
RECOMMENDATION INCLUDES 
EVALUATION FOR NOT ONLY THE 
TYPICAL SIGNS OF EARLY DISEASE 
BUT THE LESS TYPICAL SIGNS SUCH 
AS BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS.
I'M NOTING THIS AS A COMMENT FOR
US TO INCORPORATE.
THANK YOU.
SHOULD WE TRY AGAIN?
&gt;&gt; IN THE TEAMS PLATFORM
AT THE 
TOP THERE'S A CAMERA ICON.
WE ENABLED TO USE THE BUTTONS.
SO YOU CLICK ON IT AND IT SHOULD
UNMUTE YOU.
I CAN SEE DALE YOU STILL 
[INDISCERNIBLE] 
&gt;&gt; IT LOOKS LIKE ERIC IS 
UNMUTED.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.
YES AND THANK YOU DR. KONKWLO.
LET'S HEAR FROM YOU.
&gt;&gt; IT KIND OF GOES BACK
AND 
FORTH BETWEEN A MUTE AND BLOCKED
SIGN WHICH MAKES ME THINK IT'S 
NOT JUST -- 
&gt;&gt; I'M TRYING TO MUTE AND
UNMUTE
BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON IT'S NOT
ABLE TO [INDISCERNIBLE] 
&gt;&gt; HI, DR. MCCARTNEY.
MAYBE IT'S THAT WHEN LLOYD IS 
DOING IT I THINK THE USER IS 
SIMULTANEOUSLY TRYING TO UNMUTE 
THEMSELVES.
IT MAY CAUSE A PROBLEM.
WE ALSO HAVE A LINK ON VIDEOCAST
WHERE YOU CAN SUBMIT WRITTEN 
COMMENTS.
WE'LL BUT THAT INFORMATION ON 
THE SLIDE SO EVERYONE CAN SEE 
IT.
THIS IS REALLY THE IMPORTANT 
PART OF THE MEETING AND WHAT I 
CARE ABOUT MOST IS GETTING INPUT
FROM ALL OF YOU.
SORRY FOR THE TECHNICAL 
PROBLEMS.
&gt;&gt; IS IT POSSIBLE TO
UNLOCK THE 
CHAT?
&gt;&gt; RAUL, DO YOU WANT TO
ASK A 
QUESTION?
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THE
WONDERFUL 
QUESTIONS COMMENT ON THE 
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS IN 
THIS POPULATIONS AND CURRENT 
MEDICATIONS.
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE QUESTION IS
CAN 
WE COMMENT ON THE 
NEUROPSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS.
I THINK IT'S A NICE POINT THAT 
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN 
WE'RE EVALUATING PATIENTS IN 
PRIMARY SETTING WE'RE LOOKING 
FOR THOSE SYMPTOMS.
ANYONE ELSE IN THE SESSION WANT 
TO COMMENT?
&gt;&gt; I WOULD JUST OFFER IT'S
ALSO 
IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF 
COORDINATED CARE TO IDENTIFY THE
SYMPTOMS AND HAVE A COORDINATED 
APPROACH TO CLINICAL AND 
NON-CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR 
THE SYMPTOMS.
SO THE DRUG THERAPIES AS PERHAPS
LAST RESORT BUT KNOWING THERE'S 
A LOT OF NON-DRUG INTERVENTIONS 
NON-EMERGENCY SITUATIONS ARE 
TRIED INITIALLY AND IN MANY 
CASES ARE ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL 
BUT JUST KNOWING WE NEED TO 
CONTINUE ADVANCING THE RESEARCH 
ABOUT THE NON-PHARMACOLOGIC AND 
PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS AND 
THE CLINICIANS AND INDIVIDUALS 
WITH COGNITIVE EXPERIENCES HAVE 
A FULL COMPLEMENT TO ADDRESS THE
INCREDIBLY SERIOUS AND COMPLEX 
MANIFESTATIONS OF COGNITIVE 
IMPAIRMENT FROM INDIVIDUALS.
 
&gt;&gt; THAT DOVETAILS NICELY
WITH 
DR. SNYDER'S PRESENTATION FOR 
TREATING AND DIAGNOSING AND 
PROVIDING CURES TO THESE 
DISORDERS.
IT'S A NICE WAY TO TIE THEM 
TOGETHER.
&gt;&gt; MAYBE JUST TO ADD --
SORRY, I
CAN'T TURN ON MY CAMERA.
MAYBE JUST TO ADD THE ONE PIECE 
AS WE THINK ABOUT THE SPECTRUM 
OF SYMPTOMS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL 
MY EXPERIENCE.
WE WERE INTENTIONAL IN TALKING 
AROUND PRIMARY AND SECONDARY 
PREVENTION AND DISEASES IS 
POTENTIALLY SOMETHING VERY 
DIFFERENT AND WE MADE THAT 
DISTINCTION WITHIN OUR 
DISCUSSIONS AND THINKING ABOUT 
BEHAVIORAL CONSIDERATIONS A 
PERSON MADE PART OF THAT AS WE 
THINK ABOUT THE PRIMARY AND 
SECONDARY PREVENTION.
OF COURSE THE FULL SPECTRUM OF 
THE RECOMMENDATION.
&gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.
AND I'D JUST ENCOURAGE DALE AND 
AN I'LL TURN NOW TO SARA 
DELANEY.
&gt;&gt; AND IN TREATING
DEMENTIA FOR 
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A 
CAREGIVER OR SOCIALLY ISOLATED.
I WONDERED IF THAT WAS PART OF 
THAT.
&gt;&gt; THIS IS EXPLICITLY PART
OF 
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 
IMPROVING COLLABORATIVE DEMENTIA
CARE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE
WITHOUT AN INVOLVED CAREGIVER 
THAT LIVE ALONE.
SOMETHING WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT 
ACROSS ALL FOUR OF OUR 
RECOMMENDATIONS SO I'M NOTING 
THIS.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; LET'S TRY MIA.
&gt;&gt; HI, THANK YOU ALL.
I'M ONE OF THE PARTICIPATING 
GUIDE SITES.
ONE THING I WANTED TO BRING UP 
IS THAT THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO 
ARE ELIGIBLE FOR GUIDE IS 
SMALLER THAN POTENTIALLY 
ELIGIBLE BECAUSE IT'S ONLY FOLKS
WITH TRADITIONAL MEDICARE.
I'M WONDERING IF THE PRESENTERS 
HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS OR ADVOCACY
ON THE PART OF ASKING MEDICARE 
ADVANTAGE PROGRAMS TO ALSO 
CONSIDER A COLLABORATIVE 
DEMENTIA CARE MODEL BECAUSE THAT
IS THE MAJORITY OF THE MARKET IN
MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.
&gt;&gt; DO YOU WANT TO TAKE
THIS OR 
SHOULD I?
&gt;&gt; I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.
THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTION.
SO, TWO POINTS, IS ONE, YES, THE
ADVOCACY COMMUNITY AND OTHERS 
ARE WORKING HARD TO EXPAND 
ACCESS BEYOND PARTICIPANT SITES 
FOR THE OTHER 7 MILLION NOT 
ELIGIBLE TO ENSURE SHAY HAVE 
ACCESS AND THERE ARE MANY OTHER 
AVENUES TO IMPROVE DEMENTIA CARE
OUTSIDE OF THIS MODEL FROM CMS.
ON A RECOMMENDATION SITE YOU SAW
REFERENCE TO HCVS.
AND IT'S COMMUNITY-BASED 
SERVICES.
MANY ARE UNCOORDINATED THROUGH 
VARIOUS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND WE
WANT TO SEE GREATER COORDINATION
BETWEEN NOT ONLY CLINICAL 
PROVIDERS BUT NON-CLINICAL 
SUPPORT PROVIDERS.
THAT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH THE 
GUIDE MODEL AND THROUGH 
MEDICARE.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S 
ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE NOT PART OF
THE MODEL AND WANT TO TRY TO 
PUSH MEDICARE TO DEVELOP THE 
EVIDENCE THROUGH THE GUIDE MODEL
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HOPEFULLY
FASTER THAN THE MODEL AND GET 
THIS TO A FULL MEDICARE BENEFIT 
BOTH FOR TRADITIONAL MEDICARE 
AND MEDICARE ADVANTAGE 
PARTICIPANTS HOPEFULLY SOONER 
THAN EIGHT YEARS.
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE
MORE 
QUESTION AND THEN AFTER THAT 
PLEASE STAY ON AND AMBER 
MCCARTNEY WILL GIVE GUIDANCE ON 
PROVIDING WRITTEN COMMENTS AND 
SUPPORT ON THE MICROPHONE 
ISSUES.
WE HAVE A COMMENT OR QUESTION.
&gt;&gt; AS THE BEEN WONDERFUL
TO 
LISTEN TO ALL THE PRIORITIES.
I'M JUST FOLLOWING UP ON AN 
EARLIER QUESTION IN TERMS OF 
DIAGNOSES.
I WORK WITH CARE PARTNERS OF 
PEOPLE WITH LEWY BODY DEMENTIA.
ONE COMMENT THAT COMES UP FROM 
SPOUSES AND SINCE MANY ARE WOMEN
AND OLDER ADULTS, BECAUSE OF THE
FLUCTUATIONS IN COGNITION IN 
LEWY BODY DEMENTIA IS SOMETHING 
THAT SOMETIMES BECOMES TRICKY.
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS MAY NOT 
NOTICE IT WHEN THEY SEE THE 
PATIENT, THEY THINK THE PATIENT 
IS FUNCTIONING PERFECTLY FINE 
AND RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS 
PERFECTLY FINE WHILE THE SPOUSE 
AT HOME IS SEEING THE 
FLUCTUATION.
NOTING THE FLUCTUATIONS IS ONE 
THING TO COMMENT ON AS THE 
DIAGNOSTIC IMPORTANCE.
&gt;&gt; YES, OF COURSE.
I WANTED TO INVITE JULIE OR I'LL
NOTE THE IMPORTANT COMMENT THAT 
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE 
DETECTION AND DIAGNOSIS IN 
PRIMARY CARE AND THIS IS 
SOMETHING THEY KNOW ABOUT AND 
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR.
WITH THAT WE'LL LEAVE COMMENTS 
AND I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THOSE 
WHO HAD A COMMENT AND WEREN'T 
ABLE TO SHARE IT, PLEASE PROVIDE
IT IN WRITING.
WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH EVERY 
ONE OF THE COMMENTS AND THINK 
HOW TO INTEGRATE THEM IN THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS.
THIS IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY.
I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER -- 
ACTUALLY, YOU HAVE A BREAK FOR 
ONLY 11 MINUTES.
WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK AT THE 
HOUR FOR OUR NEXT SESSION ON
FRONTAL TEMPORAL DEMENTIA AND 
COME BACK ON FOR GUIDANCE ON
COMMENTS OR USING YOUR
MICROPHONE.
&gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO GET
STARTED 
AND LINDE JACOBS WILL BE ON I 
INTRODUCE YOU.
THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY WHO 
WORKED ON THE SETTINGS.
I HOPE IT'S GOING TO WORK 
BETTER.
FRANK, ARE YOU READY?
&gt;&gt; IT'S MY PLEASURE TO
INTRODUCE
LINDE JACOBS WHO SERVED ON OUR 
SUBCOMMITTEE AND HAS BEEN A 
WONDERFUL ADVOCATE FOR FTD AND 
SOMEONE WHO I LEARNED A LOT 
FROM.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THE 
INTRODUCTION.
GOOD MORNING.
MY NAME IS LINDE JAKESCOBS IT'S 
PRIVILEGE AND HONOR TO SPEAK TO 
YOU AT THE 2025 ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE-RELATED DIMENTIAS 
SUMMIT.
I COME TO THIS MEETING NOT ONLY 
AS A PARTICIPANT SERVING ON THE 
FTD SUBCOMMITTEE BUT I'VE BEEN 
AFFECTED BY FAMILY DESTROYED BY 
FRONTAL TEMPORAL DEMENTIA AND 
THESE GUIDELINE CURATED TO 
DETERMINE WHO, WHAT AND WEAR 
APPRECIATION FUNDING ALLOCATIONS
WILL BE SLOTTED AND IF CHOSEN 
INCORRECTLY WILL WILL DICTATE 
WHETHER THERE'S SOMETHING FOR ME
IN THE NEXT YEAR AND IF I TOO 
WILL SUCCUMB TO THE MISCODING IN
MY GENOME.
I WAS ASKED TO SHARE MY STORY 
WITH FTD AND HOW TO IT'S CREATED
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AS A 
PERSON WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE ON 
A SCIENTIFIC SUBCOMMITTEE.
BEING THE VOICE FOR MY COMMUNITY
AND ADVOCATING FOR THOSE WHO 
WORK THIS PATH ALONG SIDE.
YOU'LL NOTICE I LACK 
CREDENTIALS.
THERE'S NO Ph.D. OR EVEN A 
MASTER'S DEGREE.
I DON'T HOLD HIGHLY REGARDED 
ACRONYMS THAT FALL ON MY NAME.
IT'S STRANGE I FIND MYSELF 
SPEAKING TO INDIVIDUALS WITH THE
HIGHEST OF I.Q.s AND CREDENTIALS
AND RESUMES.
IT'S NOT THE CROWD I ENVISIONED 
I'D BE IN.
I WANT TO SEE CHANGES IN THE 
FIELD TO GET FTD FROM A PLACE OF
TERMINAL DISEASE TO DIAGNOSIS 
WITH OPTION TO TREAT OR CURE 
BEFORE MY BRAIN SUCCUMBS IT'S 
IMPERATIVE I TALK ABOUT MY 
FAMILY BECAUSE IT'S MY FUTURE.
I'M THE FUTURE FACE OF FTD AND 
THE SUBJECTS IN THE GRANTS AND 
THE PATIENTS IN THE PRIORITIES.
WHAT WE DECIDE HERE BECOMES MY 
LIFE LINE.
I HAVE NO DISCLOSURES TO REPORT.
I'M A WIFE AND MOTHER TO YOUNG 
YOUNG DAUGHTERS AND HAVE BEEN A 
REGISTERED NURSE WORKING IN A 
VARIETY OF SETTINGS AND WORK IN 
AMBULATORY SURGERY.
BEING IN THE COMPANY OF THOSE IN
HEALTH CARE IS SOMETHING I'M 
WELL ACCUSTOMED TO BUT I 
INTENTIONALLY CHOSE NOT TO 
OBTAIN AN ADVANCED NURSING 
DEGREE.
I WAS A CAREGIVER FOR MY MOTHER 
STARTING AT THE AGE OF 22 AFTER 
I GRADUATED COLLEGE UNTIL SHE 
PASSED IN AUGUST OF 2021.
I WILL BE THE THIRD KNOWN 
GENERATION IN MY FAMILY AFFECTED
BY BEHAVIORAL VARIANT FTD AS A 
KNOWN MAP 2 MUTATION CARRIER.
FOLLOWING MY GENERATION, THERE 
ARE SIX CHILDREN IN THE NEXT WHO
ARE NOW ALL FACING 50/50 ODDS OF
BEING FLAGGED, IN OTHER WORDS, 
GENETIC FTD WILL CONTINUE TO 
DESTROY GENERATIONS OF FTD UNTIL
THERE'S SOMETHING DONE TO STOP 
IT.
FTD HAS BEEN A CURSE ON MY 
FAMILY SINCE THE TIME I WAS 
BORN.
MY GRANDMOTHER STARTED 
EXHIBITING SYMPTOMS OF FTD AND 
LANGUISHED FOR THE DISEASE WITH 
15 YEARS UNTIL 2006.
JUST THREE YEARS AFTER MY 
GRANDMOTHER PASSED, MY MOTHER, 
ALLISON'S BRAIN STARTED TO 
CHANGE AT THE AGE OF 50.
DESPITE A FAMILY HISTORY AND 
DAUGHTER WORKING IN THE MEDICAL 
FIELD, IT TOOK US EIGHT YEARS TO
GAIN A DIAGNOSIS OF FTD IN 2018.
MY MOTHER PASSED IN 2022 AFTER 
12 YEARS OF THIS DISEASE.
TO DATE MY GRANDMOTHER BEVERLY 
AND ALL FOUR OF HER CHILDREN 
RECEIVED DIAGNOSIS OF BEHAVIORAL
VARIANT FTD WITH CONFIRMED 
GENETIC PINNINGS.
ONCE MY MOTHER AS A FIGHT ENDED,
I RECEIVE D MY RESULTS AND GOT 
CONFIRMATION THE FAMILIAL CURSE 
LIVES IN ME AND NOW POSSIBLY 
BOTH OF MY DAUGHTERS.
I WAS TOO LATE TO SPARE THEM.
MY SISTERS THEN PROCEED WITH 
THEIR OWN GENETIC TESTING 
THEREAFTER AND THEIR RESULTS 
MATCHED MINE.
POSITIVE.
WHICH MEANS ALL SIX OF THOSE 
CHILDREN IN THE PICTURES ON THE 
LEFT ARE ALL FACING THE GENETIC 
COIN TOSS THAT COMES WITH 
AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT DISEASES.
THE CHILDREN ARE ABOUT WHAT 
GIVES ME THE TIRELESS ENERGY TO 
CONTINUE TO FIGHT.
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF IT WOULD 
BE EASIER TO PRETEND I DON'T 
KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE 
AND IT'S THE DECISIONS WE MAKE 
TODAY TO FUND TOMORROW TO 
DETERMINE THEIR FUTURE.
THERE'S MORE TO DO SO IT'S 
EASILY RECOGNIZED AND DIAGNOSED 
WITH THOSE FIRST COMING INTO 
CONTACT WITH PATIENTS.
HETEROGENEITY MAKES IT 
DIAGNOSTICALLY CHALLENGING IT 
TAKES OVER THREE YEARS AFTER 
SYMPTOMS START TO GAIN A CORRECT
DIAGNOSIS.
WHICH MEANS THE ATROPHY HAD 
ALREADY BEEN OCCURRING THREE 
YEARS PRIOR TOE THAT FOR FIRST 
SYSTEM.
WITH FTD BEING A YOUNGER ONSET 
DISEASE AFFECTING A PERSON IN 
THE PRIME OF THEIR ADULT LIFE, 
THERE'S SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES 
THE PERSON AND FAMILY FACES.
LEGAL ISSUES WITH GAINING PROPER
CONTROL OVER THE INDIVIDUAL 
WHILE STILL MAINTAINING THEIR 
AUTONOMY, ECONOMIC ISSUES WITH 
ASSETS, THE IMPACT ON THE ENTIRE
FAMILY AS SOMEONE TYPICALLY 
RAISING DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND 
PROVIDING INCOME FOR THEIR 
FAMILY.
THERE'S A VERY APPARENT LACK OF 
AWARENESS IN THE PUBLIC EYE AND 
EVEN WITH MANY HEALTH 
PRACTITIONERS, STATING SYMPTOMS 
LIKE EXECUTIVE REASONING 
IMPAIRMENT, DISINHIBITION AND 
OTHER SYMPTOMS NO ONE KNOWS AND 
HARD TO DESCRIBE WITHOUT SHOWING
AN EXAMPLE AS EACH SPECIFIC 
PERSON OWN DISINHIBITION MAY NOT
LOOK THE SAME AS SOMEONE ELSE'S.
SO WE ON THE FTD SUBCOMMITTEE 
FOR THE NEXT SET OF MILESTONES 
HAVE A HUGE UNDERTAKING FOR 
CONSIDERATIONS.
IT'S NOT JUST NEEDING DIAGNOSTIC
MEASURES AND TREATMENTS, WE ALSO
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S 
CAUSING THE DISEASE.
WHERE'S IT HAPPENING AND WHAT 
TYPES OF THERAPIES A PERSON CAN 
BE A PART OF.
ARE THEY SEEING THE CORRECT 
PRACTITIONER AS WELL AS FINDING 
WAYS TO UNDERSTAND THE DISEASE 
TO THEN IMPLEMENT THE MILESTONES
TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
AT THIS TIME I WANTED TO GIVE A 
SPECIFIC MENTION OF GRATITUDE 
AND THANKS FOR ALL THE THINGS 
THE NIA, NIH AND NINDS HAS 
FUNDED.
I'VE BEEN GIVEN THE GIFT OF 
BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN 
RESEARCH THE LAST FOUR YEARS.
THAT'S FOUR YEARS OF IMAGING 
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN WITHOUT
COST.
THESE STUDIES HAVE PROVIDED ME 
THE OPTION TO GET A BASELINE MRI
STARTING AT THE AGE OF 32.
THE ONE PIECE THAT COULD HAVE 
DRASTICALLY ALTERED GETTING MY 
MOM DIAGNOSED SOONER AND TESTING
AND COGNITIVE TESTING AND 
FURTHER IMAGING.
EVERY TIME GIVING ME THE 
VALIDATION THINGS ARE STABLE 
RIGHT NOW.
IT'S TERRIFYING THE STUDIES ARE 
IN JEOPARDY.
THERE WAS LACK OF SCIENTIFIC 
DISCOVERY HOWEVER, AFTER THE 
LAST THREE YEARS OF TRYING TO 
UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING DISCOVERY 
ENTAIL I'VE CHANGED FROM 
FRUSTRATION TO AWE.
LEARNING HOW EACH RESEARCHER'S 
WORK PROVIDES A PIECE TO THE 
PUZZLE TO DISCOVERY CREATED 
PROFOUND GRATITUDE FOR THE WORK 
EVERYONE ON THE CALL IS DOING.
THIS IS A COMMUNITY FIGHT.
NOT A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL'S QUEST.
I REALIZE HOW MANY ALLIES ARE 
FIGHTING FOR WHAT I'M FIGHTING, 
AN END TO THESE DISEASE.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TENACITY AND 
DETERMINATION.
I FEEL HONORED TO BE A MEMBER OF
THIS GROUP.
WHEN I WAS FIRST ASKED TO SERVE 
AS THE PWLE ON THE COMMITTEE I 
WAS QUITE TERRIFIED TO BE THE 
SOLE VOICE OF MY COMMUNITY.
I HAD SEVERE IMPOSTER SYNDROME 
AND QUESTIONED IF I WAS THE 
RIGHT CHOICE.
I KNEW IF I HAD TO ENSURE THAT 
MY VOICE SERVED AS THE VOICE AND
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WHOLE FTD 
COMMUNITY.
WITHIN MY ADVOCACY WORK, I 
TYPICALLY HAVE A TARGETED FOCUS 
ON GENETIC FTD BUT THIS REQUIRED
ME TO HAVE A UNIFIED VOICE, 
FAMILIAL, SPORADIC AND GENETIC 
AND I SENT MULTIPLE E-MAILS IN 
THE FTD COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE I
UNDERSTOOD MY ROLE AND GET 
FEEDBACK FOR TOP PRIORITIES AND 
MILESTONES.
THOUGH MY VOICE WAS THE ONE 
HEARD IN THE DISCUSSIONS IN THE 
LAST MONTHS, I WAS THE MEGA 
PHONE FOR OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS.
ONE OF THE BLARING SHARED 
MESSAGE IS WE NEED DIAGNOSTIC 
TOOLS AND BIOMARKERS AND 
TREATMENTS AND THERAPIES AS THE 
FIRST, HIGHEST, TOP PRIORITY.
AS SOMEONE WHO WATCHED THE 
DEBILITATING DISEASE DESTROY A 
PERSON'S LIFE I WAS IN ABSOLUTE 
AGREEMENT.
AS A COMMUNITY, WE NEED TO 
DEVELOP WAYS TO MORE EASILY 
DIAGNOSIS FTD AND THE SUB TYPES 
AND WAYS TO DETERMINE WHICH 
UNDERLYING PATHOLOGY WE'RE 
WORKING WITH AND THEN WE NEED TO
FIND A WAY TO TREAT THIS DISEASE
WHETHER IT'S CURATE OR SYMPTOM 
MANAGEMENT BUT TRYING TO SOLVE 
THE PROBLEM IS OF THE HIGHEST 
PRIORITY.
BECAUSE ISN'T THAT TRULY WHAT 
WE'RE ALL TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH?
AREN'T WE HERE TO FORMULATE WAYS
TO CURE THESE DISEASES?
I REORGANIZED THE MILESTONES OF 
RENOWN CLINICIANS TO VOICE AN 
OPINION I DIDN'T FEEL I HAD 
EARNED.
AFTER SUGGESTING A REORDERING TO
SET A PRECEDENT OF DIAGNOSTICS 
AND TREATMENTS AS THE HIGHEST 
PRIORITY, DO WANT TO KNOW WHAT 
HAPPENED?
THEY LISTENED.
NOT ONLY DID THEY LISTEN, THEY 
AGREED AND THEY TOOK ACTION.
NOW, THE MILESTONES FOR FTD FOR 
THE NEXT THREE YEARS REFLECT 
THIS, NUMBER ONE, ACCELERATE THE
EVALUATION OF NOVEL FTD 
TREATMENTS AND NUMBER TWO, 
ADVANCE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ARRAY 
OF STANDARDIZED BIOMARKERS IN 
DIGITAL HEALTH TECHNOLOGY FOR 
SCREENING.
THAT MOMENT WAS SOMETHING I WILL
NEVER FORGET.
TO BE VALIDATED IN A WAY THAT 
BOLDLY DEMONSTRATED MY VOICE, MY
OPINION AND MY POSITION WITHIN 
THIS SUBCOMMITTEE WAS JUST AS 
VALUED AS EVERYONE ELSE'S.
FOR THAT I REALLY WANT TO THANK 
THOSE WHO SERVE ON THE FTD 
SUBCOMMITTEE FOR GIVING ME THE 
OPPORTUNITY AND FOR YOUR 
SUPPORT.
IT'S STILL MISUNDERSTOOD AND 
UNDER DIAGNOSED AND UNDER FUNDED
AND FOR MANY STILL A MYSTERY.
WE NEED MOMENTUM IN SCIENCE, 
CARE AND COMMUNITY AND EARLIER 
DETECTION AND MORE TRIALS AND 
SUPPORT FOR THE CAREGIVERS AND 
ACCESS TO SPECIALISTS AND 
THERAPIES THAT REFLECT THE 
COMPLEXITY OF THIS DISEASE.
THIS HOPE IS WHAT DRIVES ME TO 
PUSH BOUNDARIES AND SEEK ANSWERS
AND SUPPORT OTHERS ON THE 
JOURNEY.
IT IS A HOPE ROOTED IN SCIENCE, 
NURTURED BY COMMUNITY AND 
PROPELLED BY UNWAVERING 
DETERMINATION.
HOPE IS THE FIGHT.
THE RELENTLESS PUSH FORWARD 
UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO 
PUSH.
I'M AWARE OF THE REALITY THERE'S
NO GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE A 
TREATMENT IN TIME TO SAVE ME BUT
WITH THE INTELLIGENCE AND 
DETERMINATION I SAW IN THIS 
COMMITTEE, I KNOW THAT MY 
DAUGHTERS WILL BE GIVEN OPTION 
AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A 
DIFFERENT FUTURE.
ONE THEY WON'T HAVE TO FIGHT SO 
HARD FOR.
MAY WE ALL CONTINUE TO KEEP 
FILING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.
THANK YOU.
-- FIGHTING FOR THE NEXT 
GENERATION.
THANK YOU.
 
&gt;&gt; DO YOU WARRANT TO  --
WANT TO
TAKE US IN THE NEXT SESSION?
&gt;&gt; I'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU
ALL 
ON BEHALF OF MY CO-CHAIR, I'M 
CELESTE KARCH.
WE JUST HEARD BEAUTIFULLY FROM 
LINDY ABOUT THE REAL JOURNEY AND
COMPLEX DIAGNOSIS.
WHEN WE THINK OF FRONTAL 
TEMPORAL DEMENTIA WE'RE THINKING
ABOUT THE COMPLEX SET OF 
SYMPTOMS THAT CAN PRESENT IN 
THREE MAJOR WAYS AND THEY'RE 
MEDICAL TERMS AND WHAT WE SEE IS
THAT THE REAL WAY IN WHICH 
PATIENTS ARE COMING INTO THE 
CLINICS IS WITH CLINICAL 
PRESENTATIONS MORE COMPLEX THAN 
THESE THREE VERY BROAD 
CATEGORIES OF CLINICAL 
PRESENTATIONS THAT BOTH 
INCORPORATE THE KEY FEATURES AS 
WELL AS CAPTURE ASPECTS OF 
PARKINSON'S OR ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE OR EVEN ALS.
AND SO THIS COMPLEX CLINICAL 
PRESENTATION OF FTD REALLY 
REQUIRES WE PUT FORTH INNOVATIVE
APPROACHES TO DIAGNOSE AND 
MONITOR THE PROGRESSION OF 
DISEASE AND FIGURE OUT WHICH 
TREATMENT BEST FOR WHICH FORMS 
OF DISEASE.
NOT JUST IN THE CLINIC BUT IF WE
GO BACK TO THE MOLECULAR CAUSES 
OF DISEASE WE'RE REMINDED FTD IS
AN UMBRELLA TERM THAT REPRESENTS
SEVERAL DIFFERENT SUB TYPES.
THEY'RE INITIATED BY A NUMBER OF
DIFFERENT GENES IN FAMILIAL 
FORMS LIKE T THESE AND ULTIMATEY
WHETHER SPORADIC OR FAMILIAL IT 
CAN LEAD TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF 
PATHOLOGY THAT ACCUMULATES IN 
DISEASE AND IN THE BRAIN.
SO WE MUST CONSIDER THESE AS 
WE'RE DEVELOPING THE TREATMENTS 
AND EVEN THE DIAGNOSES TO DEFINE
IN THE CLINIC WHICH SUB TYPE AN 
INDIVIDUAL PRESENTS ITSELF AS.
ULTIMATELY THE RECOMMENDATIONS 
YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT IN THE SESSION
ARE REALLY BUILDING OFF THE 
URGENT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO 
DIAGNOSIS FTD AND TO UNDERSTAND 
OF THE SUB TYPES AND EFFECTIVELY
MANAGE AND ASSIGN THE BEST 
TREATMENT FOR THE SUB TYPES.
AND IN ORDER TO DO THIS WE STILL
NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE 
FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISMS THAT 
DRIVE DISEASE AND WORK ACROSS 
THE MODALITIES FROM THE PATIENT 
POPULATIONS ALL THE WAY INTO OUR
MODEL SYSTEMS AND BACK AGAIN.
AND THESE MILESTONES AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE REALLY BUILT
OFF WHAT IS AN EXCEEDINGLY 
EXCITING TIME IN THE FTD FIELD 
WHERE WE'RE GETTING AT NEW 
BIOMARKERS, NEW MECHANISMS, NEW 
MODELS AND THOSE I THINK ARE ALL
A REFLECTION OF THE SUPPORT THAT
CAME FROM THE LAST SUMMIT'S 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THESE NEW 
RECOMMENDATIONS YOU'LL HEAR ARE 
REALLY A REFLECTION OF WHERE 
WE'RE AT AND WHERE WE CAN GO TO 
MEANINGFULLY TREAT THIS 
DEVASTATING DISEASE.
I'LL STOP THERE.
WE CAN GO ON TO DR. BOXER.
&gt;&gt; DR. BOXER: THANK YOU
FOR 
INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY.
I'M GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT 
THE FIRST AND FIFTH 
RECOMMENDATIONS.
HERE'S MY DISCLOSURES.
SO THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION THAT
OUR COMMITTEE CAME UP WITH IS TO
ACCELERATE THE EVALUATION OF 
NOVEL FTD TREATMENTS BY BOTH 
CAPITALIZING ON EXISTING 
EVIDENCE, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
RESOURCES AND ON THE DEVELOPMENT
OF FTD SPECIFIC DESIGNS AND NEW 
PREVENTION AND TREATMENT TRIALS 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
U.S. POPULATION AND IT'S TOP 
PRIORITY AND YOU HEARD FROM 
LINDE JACOBS JUST NOW HOW 
IMPORTANT IT IS TO OUR 
COMMUNITIES.
SO IMPORTANT TO MENTION THERE 
ARE NO APPROVED TREATMENTS FOR 
FTD IN ANY FORM.
AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE LIMITED AS 
PHYSICIAN TO USE 
NON-PHARMACOLOGIC APPROACHES AND
SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENTS WITH 
PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS BUT 
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SLOW THE 
INEXTRICABLE COURSE OF THIS 
DISEASE TOWARDS SEVERE 
DISABILITY AND DEATH IN MANY 
PEOPLE.
DESPITE THIS AN EXCITING TIME 
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TREATMENT
FOR NEURAL DEGENERATIVE DISEASES
AND SEEN IN SOD 1 ALS IT'S 
POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP DISEASE 
MODIFYING DRUGS TO SLOW 
PROGRESSION OF DISEASE AND HAVE 
AN IMPORTANT IMPACT OF SURVIVAL.
WE CAN LEARN FROM THE EXPERIENCE
AND BRING THIS TO FTD.
WE'RE ALSO SEEING IN OTHER 
DISEASES TAU AND TDP43 
TREATMENTS ARE BEING DEVELOPED 
TO INTO AND THE CLINIC AND MAY 
BE WE CAN ALSO TEST THEM FOR 
OVED.
THEY MAY ALSO WORK BETTER THAN 
FOR OTHER NEUROGENE RATIVE 
DISEASES.
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE 
SUPPORT FROM THE NATIONAL 
INSTITUTE ON AGING AND 
NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND 
STROKE FOR THE ALL FTD RESEARCH 
NETWORK AND THE FTD DISORDERS 
REGISTRY WHICH HAS BUILT THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGHOUT NORTH 
AMERICA TO SUPPORT THE NEXT 
GENERATION OF FTD TRIALS.
THIS IS A BIT OF A BUSY CHART 
AND WANT TO ILLUSTRATE TO YOU 
USING ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND 
SOD-1 RELATED ALS AS DISEM 
PARTICULARS -- EXEMPLARS AND 
IT'S PROVEN VIABLE FOR THE 
INDICATIONS.
IN FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA WHAT 
YOU CAN SEE IS THERE ARE REALLY 
TWO FORMS.
THOSE LINKED TO GOOD MORNINGS OR
FAMILIAL FTD AND SPORADIC FORMS 
OF FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA 
DEGENERATION.
YOU CAN SEE IN THE RIGHT IN BLUE
ARE HOW FAR DRUG DEVELOPMENT HAS
MADE IT IN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR 
THESE VARIOUS DIFFERENT FORMS OF
FTD.
AND HOPEFULLY WHAT YOU CAN 
NOTICE IT'S THE AVAILABILITY OF 
BIOMARKERS AND YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT
THIS IN IN THE NEXT 
RECOMMENDATION THAT'S REALLY 
ALLOWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE
CLINICAL TRIALS.
AS WE THINK OF THE NEXT FIVE 
YEARS OF THE FTD NETWORK WE'RE 
FOCUSSING ON PREPARING FOR 
CLINICAL TRIALS AND DEVELOPING 
MORE BIOMARKERS AND MORE TOOLS 
TO DO CLINICAL TRIALS THROUGHOUT
THE FIRST SPECTRUM OF FTD.
SO WHAT OTHER ADVANCES HAVE 
HAPPENED SINCE THE LAST SUMMIT?
IMPORTANTLY WE'RE EXCITED THE 
FIRST TRIAL RESULTS WERE 
REPORTED EARLIER THIS YEAR AND 
THIS WAS WITH A SYMPTOMATIC 
AGENT THAT REALLY SEEMS TO HAVE 
AN IMPORTANT IMPACT ON THE 
SYMPTOMS OF BEHAVIORAL VARIANT 
FTD.
THIS IS INTRANASAL OXYTOCIN FOR 
FTD.
WE'VE ALSO SEEN IN PROGRANULIN 
RELATED FTD THAT GENE THERAPY 
WITH INTRAFECALLY ADMINISTERED 
VIRAL VECTOR PROGRANULIN CAN 
CORRECT THE CHEMICAL ASSOCIATED 
WITH A PROGRANULIN MUTATION AND 
AWAITING THE RESULTS OF THE 
TRIALS.
THERE'S OTHER THERAPIES OTHER 
WAY.
OUR CLINICAL TRIAL PROGRAMS 
UNDERWAY.
AND AGAIN I JUST WANT TO REMIND 
YOU THAT WE ARE BUILDING UPON 
AND STARTING TO BRING SOME DRUGS
FROM OTHER INDICATIONS INTO FTD 
AND I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THIS IN 
A MINUTE.
ONE IDEA AND THIS IS NOW 
HAPPENING IN ALS BECAUSE WE KNOW
CERTAIN FORMS OF FTD INDIVIDUALS
HAVE MUTATIONS THAT PUT THEM AT 
RISK FOR DISEASE, WE MAY BE ABLE
TO DESIGN PREVENTION TRIALS 
WHERE WE INITIATE TREATMENT 
PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF SYMPTOMS.
OVER THE PAST YEAR, RESEARCHERS 
FROM THE ALS AND FTD COMMUNITIES
HAVE MET TO BEGIN PLANNING THE 
FIRST PREVENTION TRIALS OF FTD.
&gt;&gt; TWO-MINUTE WARNING.
&gt;&gt; WE ALSO ARE TAKING THE
IDEA 
OF PLASTER PROTOCOLS NEW TRIAL 
DESIGN AND FUNDED BY THE 
NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.
WE'RE BEGINNING LATER THIS YEAR 
A NEW PLATFORM TRIAL FOR 
PROGRESSIVE SUPER NUCLEAR 
POLICY.
THE IDEA OF A PERFORM TRIAL IS A
COST AND RAPID WAY TO TEST NEW 
TREATMENT OR TO DEVELOP NEW 
TREATMENTS FOR A DISEASE.
WHAT YOU SEE IS THE DESIGN OF 
THE NEW PSP TRIAL PLATFORM.
IN THIS TRIAL WE WILL BE TESTING
THREE DIFFERENT DRUGS FOR PSP 
SIMULTANEOUSLY.
INDIVIDUALS WILL BE RANDOMIZED 
TO ONE OF THE THREE DRUG 
REGIMENTS AND WITHIN EACH 
REGIMENT, THEY ARE HAVE A 3-1 
CHANCE OF RECEIVING THE DRUG.
ONE OF THE EFFICIENCIES IS WE 
CAN PULL THE PLACEBO SO WE CAN 
TEST DRUGS MORE QUICKLY WITH 
FEWER PATIENTS HAVING TO BE 
EXPOSED TO PLACEBO AND THIS WILL
CREATE A NEW RESOURCE FOR OTHER 
INVESTIGATORS AROUND THE COUNTRY
TO DEVELOP NEW TREATMENTS AND 
NEW BIOMARKERS FOR PSP.
NOW I'M GOING TO END WITH THE 
FIFTH RECOMMENDATION, 
RECOMMENDATION NUMBER 5, WHICH 
IS TO UNDERSTAND FTD 
MANIFESTATIONS AND HOW DISEASE 
FACTORS LIKE HETEROGENEITY AND 
SEX AND EXPOSOME AFFECT DISEASE 
RISK AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
AND THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF FTD.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THE 
CLINICAL DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA WE 
USED ARE BASED ON STUDIES OF 
INDIVIDUALS WITH ACCESS TO 
SPECIALIZED CARE MOSTLY IN NORTH
AMERICA AND IN EUROPE.
BUT WHAT WE'RE LEARNING IS THAT 
THERE ARE SPECIFIC GENETIC 
AFFECTS THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT 
FOR CAUSING FTD.
SO FOR THE MAJOR AUTOSOMAL 
DOMINANT FOR FAMILIAL GENE WE 
THINK THIS AROSE IN SCANDINAVIA 
AND PROGRANULIN IN MEDITERRANEAN
FAMILIES AND OTHER CAUSES FOR 
EXAMPLE IN EAST ASIA ANXA11 
MUTATION A MORE IMPORTANT CAUSE 
OF FTD.
THEY'RE ALL IMPORTANT AND 
POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT BIOMARKER 
TO DEVELOP NEW TLAPIES.
WE ALSO KNOW FOR TAUOPATHIES 
THERE'S A GENETIC FACTOR RELATED
TO TAU CALLED THE H2 ALLELE 
WHICH PROTECTS BUT IS A RISK 
FACTOR FOR ANOTHER DISEASE.
IT'S NOT PRESENT IN ASIAN 
ANCESTRIES.
AGAIN, IT'S SOMETHING THAT 
SUGGESTS WE SHOULD BE 
UNDERSTANDING THE EPIDEMIOLOGY 
AND GENETICS OF FTD THROUGHOUT 
THE WORLD BECAUSE IT MAY HELP 
DEVELOP NEW TREATMENTS.
FINALLY AGAIN, WE ARE 
INCREASINGLY COLLABORATING WITH 
OUR ALS COLLEAGUES IN THE ALL 
ALS RESEARCH NETWORK.
ONE THING WE LEARNED FROM ALS IS
THE EXPOSOME SO THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS AND 
POTENTIALLY TOXIN IN THE 
ENVIRONMENT ARE LIKELY TO BE 
IMPORTANT FOR ALS AND 
INCREASINGLY WE'RE LEARNING IT'S
IMPORTANT FOR FTD SO WE NEED TO 
FOCUS ON THIS IN COLLABORATION 
WITH OUR ALS COLLEAGUES IN THE 
FUTURE.
THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.
GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.
DAVID IRWIN FROM THE UNIVERSITY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA.
I'LL BE PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF 
THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE 
ADVANCING FTD BIOMARKERS TO 
DISENTANGLE THE FTD CLINICO 
PATHOLOGICAL HETEROGENEITY.
TO START, THE VAST HETEROGENEITY
OF FTD FROM A CLINICAL AND 
PATHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE POSES A
SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE IN TERMS OF
NOMENCLATURE AND BIOLOGICAL 
CLASSIFICATION OF FTD AND THE 
DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
MECHANISTIC AND TREATMENT 
STRATEGIES WHICH IS THE FOCUS OF
OUR SUBCOMMITTEE AS WE HEARD 
FROM THE POWERFUL TALK BY LINDE.
WHAT THERE'S PHOTO MICROGRAPHS 
OF THE ASSOCIATED PATHOLOGIES 
CAN BE FOUND MICROSCOPICALLY 
POSTMORTEM BY THE PROTEINS THAT 
AGGREGATE IN THE BRAIN CELLS AND
THERE'S TAU PROTEINS AND FTLD 
AND OTHER PROTEINOPATHIES AND 
PRIMARY ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
CHANGE CAN PRESENT WITH FOCAL 
CLINICAL SYNDROME WITHIN THE FTD
SYNDROME.
SO SUPER IMPOSING THE 
PATHOLOGIES WE CAN SEE THE MAIN 
FTD SYNDROMES COLOR CODED BY THE
FREQUENCY OF THE VARIOUS 
PATHOLOGIES BELOW AND WHAT WE 
SAW IN A PRIOR SLIDE.
YOU CAN SEE SOME SYNDROME SUCH 
AS SUPRAPROGRESSIVE PALSY IS 
PREDICTIVE AND THE VARIANT OF 
FTD HAS VARIOUS TAU AND 
PATHOLOGY COULD BE THE 
UNDERLYING CAUSE.
AND WHAT WE SAW FROM DR. KARCH 
EARLIER IS THESE SYNDROMES CAN 
OVERLAP WITH EACH OTHER.
IT SETS THE RECOMMENDATION TO 
ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN 
ARRAY OF BIOMARKERS AND DIGITAL 
HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES FOR MULTIPLE
USES TO AFFECT THE MAIN GOAL AND
PROBLEM OF THE CRITICAL 
IMPORTANCE OF AN EARLY AND 
ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS OF FTD.
THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR SCREENING 
INDIVIDUALS AT RISK TO OBTAIN 
RISKS AND IDENTIFYING BIOLOGICAL
CHANGES TO PREDICT 
PHENOCONVERSION TO MANIFEST FTD 
AND IN THE CONTEXT OF CLINICAL 
TRIALS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF 
DISEASE MONITORING, PATIENT 
STRATIFICATION TO BIOLOGICAL SUB
GROUPS WITH HOMOGENEOUS BIOLOGY 
AND ENHANCE POWER AND TOOLS TO 
DETECT TARGET ENGAGEMENT FOR 
ASSOCIATED PATHOLOGIES AS THE 
OVER ALL RECOMMENDATION.
WE PRIORITIZE LOW COST AND 
NON-INVASIVE MODALITIES.
THEY HELP FACILITATE SCREENING 
AND DIAGNOSIS, PARTICULARLY IN 
REMOTE AREAS THAT MAY NOT HAVE 
ACCESS TO TERTIARY CARE TO HELP 
EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO DIAGNOSE 
EARLY AND REDUCE THE DELAY.
EMPHASIZE NATURAL HISTORY 
STUDIES TO UNDERSTAND THE 
BIOLOGY OF FTD AND THE 
IMPORTANCE OF BRAIN DONATION TO 
VALIDATE MARKERS TESTED AND 
DEVELOPMENT AND PET IMAGING 
MODALITIES TO HELP ACCELERATE 
OUR ABILITY TO CROSS VALIDATE.
WE OBSERVED IN ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE WHERE AUTOPSIES ARE THEN
TO ABLE CROSS-VALIDATE EMERGING 
BIO FLUID BIOMARKERS RATHER THAN
TO RELY ON AUTOPSY ALONE.
AS WE MAKE GAINS IN THE AREAS 
ACCORDING TO THE RECOMMENDATION 
WE CAN PREPARE FOR BIOLOGICAL 
FRAMEWORK AND CONSIDER HOW 
BIOMARKER CLASSIFICATION EXISTS 
WITH EXISTING AND EMERGING 
STRATEGIES FOR ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE AND SYNUCLEIN MYOPATHIES
AND THE INITIATIVE.
TO BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE
ADVANCES SINCE THE LAST SUMMIT.
SOME HAVE BEEN IN BLOOD BRAIN 
BARRIER BIOMARKERS AND 
NEUROFILAMENT LIGHT CHAIN TO 
DETERMINE EARLY BIOLOGICAL 
CHANGES FOR INDIVIDUALS AT RISK 
OF DEVELOPING CLINICALLY 
MANIFESTING FTD AND UNDER GO 
QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE USE IN 
THE CONTEXT OF FAMILIAL FTD.
IN TERMS OF DIAGNOSING BIOLOGY 
AND IDENTIFYING THOSE LIKELY TO 
HAVE TAU OR TPD43 AND COMBINING 
FILAMENT LIGHT WITH OTHER 
BIOMARKERS SHOW PROMISING EARLY 
RESULTS.
PHOSPHORYLATED TAU EPITOPES TO 
DETECT PATHOLOGY IN THE CONTEXT 
OF FTD WHICH IS IMPORTANT AND 
ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE NEED 
FOR FTD SPECIFIC BIOMARKERS TO 
COMPLEMENT THESE IN THE ERA OF 
AMYLOID THERAPIES.
NEWER TECHNIQUES SUCH AS MASS 
SPEC TROSSCOPY TO LOOK AT 
PRAGMENTS OF TAU AND PROTEOMIC 
TECHNIQUES AND DERIVED EXTRA 
CELLULAR VESICLES AND PET 
TRACERS FOR FTLD FORMS OF TAI 
AND TDP43 ARE UNDERWAY.
AND THE WAY TO INTEGRATE 
BIOLOGICAL INDEXES AND 
BIOMARKERS AND BUILD STATISTICAL
MODELS OF PROGRESSION ARE AN 
IMPORTANT ADVANCE AND HELP GUIDE
CLINICAL TRIAL END POINTS AS 
WELL.
A COMPLEMENTARY RECOMMENDATION 
IS RECOMMENDATION 7 SO IDENTIFY 
THE SHARED AND DISPARATE 
MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE 
CLINICAL AND MOLECULAR SUB TYPES
INCLUSION OF CO-PATHOLOGIES AT 
THE MOLECULAR, CELLULAR, CIRCUIT
AND TISSUE LEVELS.
THIS RECOMMENDATION IS FOCUSSED 
ON COMPARATIVE STUDIES USING 
HUMAN TISSUE AND DATA AND 
TRANSLATE THE MECCISTIC STUDIES 
WE'LL HEAR ABOUT IN CLINICAL 
APPLICATION WITH AN EMPHASIS ON 
IMPROVING AND INFORMING 
RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES TARGETING
MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF FTD.
FOR EXAMPLE COMPARING FEATURES 
WITH FTD SUB TYPES WITH THE 
COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE 
BASIS FOR THE VARIOUS CLINICAL 
EXPRESSION OF TDP43 
PROTEINOPATHIES.
AND MORE CLEAR MECHANISMS AND 
HOW THEY MAY RELATE TO THE 
BIOLOGY OF SPORADIC OVEDs IS 
ANOTHER HIGH PRIORITY.
AND PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT 
CONTRIBUTE TO LANGUAGE AND 
SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND STUDY THIS 
IN THE CONTEXT OF HUMAN DISEASE 
WE PRIORITIZE STANDARDIZING NEW 
APPROACHES OF PATHOLOGY AND 
INTERROGATE HUMAN BRAIN TISSUE 
AND HOW TO INTEGRATE THESE TO 
STUDY THE BIOLOGY IN THE CONTEXT
OF THE HUMAN BRAIN CONNECTOME 
AND INTEGRATE OTHER MODEL 
SYSTEMS FROM HUMAN DERIVED DATA 
AND TISSUES.
THE OVER ALL ARCHING GOAL OF THE
PRIORITY WHICH IS A LONGER TERM 
GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY THE NEURAL 
SUBSTRATES AND MODULATING FACTOR
FOR DIFFERENT FTD SUB TYPES TO 
IDENTIFY THERAPEUTIC TARGETS AND
OPTIMIZE THERAPEUTIC CLINICAL 
TRIAL RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES.
I'LL BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE EXAMPLES 
OF RECENT BIOLOGICAL SUB TYPES 
DEPICTED ARE FINDING OF TDP43 
TYPE C HAVING CONSISTENT ANXA11 
PROTEINOPATHY AND A UNIQUE 
FEATURE IS FILAMENT STRUCTURE.
AND EXCITING WORK LOOKING AT 
CRYPTICEX  -- CRYPTIC AM  AXON 
AND FLUIDS IN THE VARIOUS FORMS 
OF PROTEINOPATHIES SHOW 
POTENTIAL MECHANISMS AND FURTHER
UNDERSTANDING OF THE CELLULAR 
AND TRANSCRIPTIONAL SUB TYPES 
AND HOW THEY RELATE ARE 
IMPORTANT.
USING DIGITAL PATHOLOGY TO 
INTERROGATE BRAIN TISSUE AND 
LOOKING AT CLINICALLY DEFINED 
GROUP AND BEHAVIORAL VARIANT OF 
FTD WE CAN STUD 
NEURODEGENERATION IN BRAIN 
PATTERNS AND CONNECTIVITY AND 
FINALLY FINDINGS OF PROGRANULIN 
AND HAPLO INSUFFICIENCY SUGGEST 
AD/ADRD AND I'D LIKE TO THANK 
OUR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WHO 
PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH.
&gt;&gt; I'M BACK.
THIS IS CELESTE KARCH IN 
ST. LOUIS AND I'LL BE SHARING 
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND MODELS 
AND MY DISCLOSURES ARE HERE.
I BRING YOU BACK TO THIS IDEA OF
THE WRESTLING WITH THE UMBRELLA 
TERM WHILE KNOWING THERE'S BIG 
CLEAR GENETIC CAUSE DIFFER 
ACROSS THE DIFFERENT FTD SUB 
TYPES AND AMONG THE NON-GENETIC 
FORMS THE SPORADIC FORMS THERE'S
DIFFERENT AS RESPECTS OF 
MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY THAT AFFECTS
THE PHENOTYPE WE SEE WHEN 
PATIENTS COME REPORT IING ISSUE.
AS WE THINK OF MODELLING 
DISEASE, PERHAPS THE TRADITIONAL
THOUGHT IS SORT OF TO MODEL THE 
CELL BASIS OF DISEASE AND WHILE 
THAT'S IMPORTANT THE COMMITTEE 
WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT MODELS 
REALLY WILL BE VALUABLE TO 
CAPTURE EVERY LEVEL OF THE 
ASPECTS OF FTD FROM THE GENETIC 
AND PATH LOGIC FEATURES AND ALSO
THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO 
EFFECTIVELY MODEL THE CLINICAL 
PRESENTATIONS.
 I WANT TO SHOW THE RECENT WORK 
IN THE LITERATURE THAT SHOW THE 
VALUE OF MODELS AND THE VALUE OF
INTEGRATIVE MODELS AND I 
APOLOGIZE FOR THE BLURRINESS OF 
THIS PICTURE AND WHAT'S EMERGED 
FROM STUDIES FROM TWO 
INDEPENDENT ROLES IS THERE'S A 
ROLE FOR TDP43 IN ALTERING 
SPECIFIC TRANSCRIPTS THAT 
PRODUCE WHAT IS TERMED CRYPTIC 
AXON WE HEARD FROM DR. IRWIN 
THAT CAN TELL US ABOUT THE 
BIOLOGY OF DISEASE AND 
POTENTIALLY SERVE AS BIOMARKERS.
WHAT THE COMPANION PAPERS SHOWED
US IS WE CAN GET AT THE IDEAS 
THROUGH VERY DIFFERENT 
APPROACHES TO MODELS.
IN THE FIRST STUDY STEM CELL 
MODELS WERE USED WHERE A WELL 
CHARACTERIZED POTENT STEM CELL 
LINE WAS MANIPULATED TO REMOVE 
TDP43 AND SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS OF
THE NEURONS REVEALED THIS CHANGE
IN IN A PARTICULAR GENE IN 13A 
WHICH HAD ALTERED CRYPTIC AXONS.
IN A PARALLEL APPROACH 
INVESTIGATORS WERE ABLE TO TAKE 
HUMAN BRAIN TISSUE FROM PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE FTD AND WERE ABLE TO 
ISOLATE NEURONS FROM THE BRAINS 
AND ASK WHAT'S THERE, WHAT'S 
DIFFERENT AND HOW DOES THAT 
COMPARE TO NORMAL CONTROL BRAINS
AND AGAIN THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE 
THIS CHANGE IN A GENE ONC 13A IN
GENERATIONS IN THE SPLICING.
SO THIS REALLY HIGHLIGHTED THE 
ADDED VALUE OF MOILING FROM 
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND 
DIFFERENT LEVELS.
IN DISCOVERY OF FUNDAMENTAL 
MECHANISMS AND TO REVEAL NEW 
BIOMARKERS AND THERAPEUTIC 
TARGETS.
ANOTHER AREA OF  MASSIVE GROWTH 
HAS BEEN ABLE TO LEVERAGE CELLS 
IN WAYS AND WHILE THE PRIOR 
STUDY USED SYSTEM MODELS TO 
REMOVE A GENE, THERE ARE EFFORTS
FOCUSSED ON TAKING CELLS FROM 
PEOPLE WHO CARRY MUTATIONS THAT 
CAUSE DISEASE LIKE THOSE LINDE 
DESCRIBED AND TO MAKE THEM INTO 
CELL TYPES IN THE BRAIN SUCH AS 
BRAIN ORGANOIDS THAT DEVELOP IN 
A MANNER THAT LOOKS LIKE THE 
DEVELOPING BRAIN.
AND THEN TO TRACK HOW THESE 
CHANGES OCCUR ORE HOW SPECIFIC 
CHANGES OCCUR OVER TIME AND HOW 
THEY COMPARE TO CELLS WHERE THE 
GENETIC MUTATION HAS BEEN 
CORRECTED.
ULTIMATELY THE EFFORTS HAVE LED 
TO A REALLY BEAUTIFUL SET OF 
PHENOTYPES THAT ARE CHANGING 
OVER TIME AND CAN BE TARGETED.
IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S A 
LOT OF GROUPS THAT HAVE MADE 
HUGE HEADWINDS IN MAKING 
FIBROBLASTS FROM PEOPLE WHO 
CARRY DIFFERENT MUTATIONS OR ARE
CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED WITH FTDs 
AND CONVERT THOSE FROM A SKIN 
CELL INTO A NEURON AND THOSE ARE
ENABLED US TO BE ABLE TO BEGIN 
TO VISUALIZE PROTEIN AGGREGATS 
IN A WAY WE HAVEN'T BEFORE.
THIS ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND THE
BIOLOGY AND AGGREGATES IN WHICH 
THEY ARE FORM AND HAVE TOOLS 
NOW, CELL LINES WE CAN SCREEN 
FOR COMPOUNDS THAT BLOCK OR 
REDUCE THE FORMATION OF THE 
AGGREGATES THAT CAN BE MOVED 
INTO TRIALS.
WITH OF THE MANY EXAMPLES I'VE 
SHOWN ARE REALLY ON EFFECTS 
WITHIN NEURONS AND THE FTD FIELD
IS SEEING A LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY 
ACROSS THE CELL TYPES THAT ARE 
FOUND IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE 
LIKELY CONTRIBUTING TO FTD AND 
MODELS ARE BEGINNING TO POINT US
IN THIS DIRECTION BUT REMAINS AN
IMPORTANT AREA OF GROWTH AND 
EMPHASIS IN THE COMING YEARS.
RECOMMENDATION 3 IS FOCUSSED ON 
A NEED TO ESTABLISH AND VALIDATE
PRECLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL 
MODELS BECAUSE WE THINK THESE 
ARE ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND 
BASIC CELLULAR MECHANISM AND TO 
GET TO THERAPEUTICS.
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MODELS I 
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE'RE 
DEFINING MODELS QUITE BROADLY.
IN FACT BECAUSE OUR MODELS ARE 
ONLY AS GOOD AS THE DISEASE THAT
WE'RE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND.
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE 
PATIENT POPULATION LOOKS LIKE 
AND HOW THE DIFFERENT SUB TYPE 
MANIFESTING IN THE BRAIN AND IN 
OTHER FEATURES LIKE IN IMAGING 
AND FLUID BIOMARKERS AND TAKING 
AN UNBIASSED APPROACH 
INTEGRATING A.I. TO DEFINE THE 
WAYS IN WHICH THE GROUPS ARE 
SIMILAR AND DISCREPANT SO OUR 
MODELS IN CELLS AND IN MICE CAN 
ULTIMATELY REFLECT THOSE 
INDIVIDUALS.
IN ORDER TO DO THIS WE REALLY 
SEE A NEED TO WORK IN 
PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS TO 
AGGREGATE THE DATA AND HARMONIZE
THE RESOURCES AND REALLY ENABLE 
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASE AND
IN DOING THIS, WE THINK THAT 
THERE'S A SPECIAL NEED TO ALSO 
FOCUS ON MODELLING THE SPORADIC 
FORMS OF DISEASE, WHICH IS 
PRESENTED AS A MAJOR CHALLENGE 
IN THE PAST.
SO I'LL STOP THERE AND THANK 
EVERYONE FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE IN
DEVELOPING THESE 
RECOMMENDATIONS.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
PRESENT HERE AT THIS ADRD 
SUMMIT.
I'LL TALK ABOUT RECOMMENDATION 
NUMBER SIX WHICH IS PRIORITY 
THREE AND THERE'S A LOT OF 
WORDS.
RECOMMENDATION SIX IS TO 
ELUCIDATE THE CELL AUTONOMOUS 
AND UNDERSTANDING SELECTIVELY 
VULNERABILITIES AND THERE BE 
IDENTIFYING NEW TARGETS FOR 
THERAPEUTIC DEVELOPMENT.
THE BULLETS ARE BASICALLY AN 
OUTLINE OF HOW I'M GOING TO GO 
THROUGH THIS BUT IT'S IMPORTANT 
FOR FOLKS TO KNOW AS DR. KARCH 
PRESENTED THE BRAIN REGIONS 
VULNERABLE AND FTD ARE 
DISTINCTIVE FROM ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE AND OTHER ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE-RELATED DIMENTIAS AND 
THEY COME IN GLIA AND IMMUNE 
CELLS AND ENDOTHELIAL CELLS I'LL
UNPACK IN A MOMENT.
IF WE CAN GAIN DEEPER 
MECHANISTIC INSIGHT WHETHER 
THEY'RE STARTING OR PROGRESSING 
IN NEURON OR NON AUTONOMOUS OR 
NON-NEURONAL CONTRIBUTIONS WILL 
HELP DEVELOP BETTER THERAPIES.
THE PROCESSES THAT INVOLVE 
NEURONS AND OTHER CELLS 
INCLUDING NEURAL INFLAMMATION 
AND SENESCENCE AND VASCULAR 
DYSFUNCTION, ETCETERA.
THE HEADLINE HIERE IS WE KNOW 
THROUGH THE COURSE OF SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH AND EFFECTIVE THERAPIES
DEVELOPED TO DATE IF WE BETTER 
UNDERSTAND DISEASE MECHANISMS 
WE'RE GOING TO GET BETTER 
THERAPIES AND TO THIS I'LL ADD 
WHAT DR. IRWIN TALKED ABOUT IS 
BETTER BIOMARKERS AND DR. BOXER 
SAID WE NEED THEM TO DO BETTER 
THERAPIES.
THE BRAIN REGIONS AFFECTED ARE 
THE FRONTO TEMPORAL LOBES AND 
EACH BRAIN REGIONS HAVE 
DIFFERENT CELLS.
NEURON THERE AND THERE'S ASTRO 
GLIA WHICH ARE THE PARENTS OF 
NEURONS, THE COUSINS OF NEURONS 
OR SIBLINGS RATHER THAN JUST A 
GLUE CELL.
MICROGLIA WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND APPENDMEL 
CELLS AND ADREN DROE SITES AND 
MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISEASES 
AND NEED TO BE STUDIED AND 
UNDERSTOOD.
ALSO THE GENETICS OF THE GENES 
FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH FTD 
ARE NOT ALWAYS EXPRESSED IN THE 
NEURONS.
THE VAST MAJORITY ARE EXPRESSED 
IN MOST CELLS.
SOMETIMES FOR PROGRANULIN IT'S 
EXPRESSED MORE IN MICROGLIA THAN
IN NEURONS AND TO TAKE AN 
EXAMPLE FROM ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
THERE'S GENES SUCH THAT ARE OATH
EXPRESSED IN MICROGLIA AND NOT 
IN NEURONS AT ALL.
IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE THINK ABOUT
THE GENETICS WE THINK ABOUT 
WHERE THE GENE MUTATION IS 
ACTING.
IN ADDITION, I THINK FOR A LONG 
TIME I THOUGHT THE AGGREGATES 
IMPLICATIONS THE TDP43 AND TAU 
AGGREGATE ONLY FOUND IN NEURONS 
WE KNOW NOW IN SUPRANUCLEAR 
PALSY YOU CAN SEE THEM IN ASTRO 
GLIA AND ADRENDOCYTES AND WE AS 
WE UNDERSTAND DISEASE MECHANISMS
IT WILL LEAD TO APPROPRIATE 
THERAPIES THAT PERHAPS TARGET 
MORE THAN NEURONS.
AS A CORRELATE WHAT I SHOULD 
HAVE ADDED IS AS WE UNDERSTAND 
MECHANISM, WE CAN BETTER 
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE NEED TO 
DEVELOP AS BIOMARKERS.
SO TOGETHER THESE MAKE UP THE 
CELL AUTONOMOUS VERSUS 
NON-AUTONOMOUS MECHANISMS.
SO SELECTIVE VULNERABILITY IS 
THE CONCEPT CERTAIN NEURONS OR 
CERTAIN CELLS IN DIFFERENT BRAIN
AFFECTED IN DIFFERENT DISEASES.
THIS TERM HAS BEEN AROUND FOR 
OVER 20 YEARS.
I REMEMBER READING REVIEWS ABOUT
THIS IN THE EARLY 2000s BUT THE 
ADVANCES WE HAVE MADE HAVE COME 
FROM UNDERSTANDING THERE'S A LOT
OF GENETIC MUTATIONS ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE DIFFERENT DISEASES.
SOMETIMES THEY'RE OVERLAPPING, 
SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT AND 
THEY'RE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE 
PURPLE BOX.
IN ADDITION, WE NOW KNOW THAT 
THERE ARE DIFFERENT CELL TYPES 
THAT MAY BE AFFECTED, FOR 
EXAMPLE, LAYER TWO VERSUS LAYER 
SIX IN BRAIN STEM VERSUS 
CORTICAL AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY 
IMPORTANT IN UNDERSTANDING 
SELECTIVE VULNERABILITY.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE DON'T 
UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES CERTAIN 
BRAIN REGIONS AND CELL TYPES 
VULNERABLE.
SO THIS IS A KEY AREA WE NEED TO
PUSH FORWARD IN TERMS OF 
DEVELOPING INSIGHT.
AMONG THE REASONS FOR MOVING 
BEYOND THE NEURON CENTRIC VIEW 
ARE THE DISTRIBUTION OF 
AGGREGATES, THE RELATIVE GENE 
EXPRESSION AND CELL 
NON-AUTONOMOUS MECHANISMS I'VE 
MENTIONED.
THESE THREE THINGS ALSO LEAD US 
TO FOCUS ON DIFFERENT PROCESSES 
FOR INVESTIGATION.
SO NEURAL INFLAMMATION WE KNOW 
IS A BIG CONTRIBUTOR IN FTD 
BECAUSE WE SEE EXPANSION OF 
GLIAL CELLS AND THERE'S THE 
INABILITY TO CLEAR PROTEINS AND 
LIPID METABOLISM IS IMPORTANT 
AND METABOLISM AND SENESCENCE 
AND THE SPREADING OF TOXIC 
PROTEINS AND VASCULAR 
DYSFUNCTION AND APOE 
MUTATIONS -- VARIANTS LEADING TO
INCREASED RISK FOR FTD ALONG 
WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND 
SLEEP DYSFUNCTION, STRESS AND 
AGING WHICH IS THE SINGLE MOST 
IMPORTANT RISK FACTOR FOR ALL 
THE NEURAL DEGENERATIVE 
DISORDERS.
SO, THE NEXT QUESTION IS WHAT IS
NEEDED TO ADVANCE THE 
RECOMMENDATION?
YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND PRESS 
THROUGH THESE.
FIRST IS CELL BIOLOGICAL TOOLS 
AND APPROACHES.
BY CELL BIOLOGICAL I MEAN THESE 
APPROACHES THAT WE DON'T YET 
KNOW AND MOST OF US DOESN'T KNOW
WE NEEDED SMARTPHONES AND CELL 
PHONES AND NOW WE CAN'T LIVE 
WITHOUT THEM AND IN TERMS OF 
SCIENTIFIC TOOLS ARE THE CRISPR 
EDITING AS WELL AS CRISPR 
INHIBITION AND ACTIVATION THAT 
HAVE NOT JUST BEEN THOUGHT OF IN
TERMS OF THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES 
BUT TRANSFORMED OUR ABILITY TO 
DO SCIENCE IN THE LAB.
AS DR. KARCH TALKED ABOUT THE 
STEM CELL AND ORGANOID MODELS 
ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND 
AS
AS
ASEMBLOIDS ARE BEING DEVELOPED.
THE ANIMAL MODELS WE HAVE IN C. 
ELEGANS AND MICE ARE IMPORTANT 
AND BECAUSE FTD AFFECTS HIGHER 
BRAIN FUNCTIONS SUCH AS SOCIAL 
COGNITION, ETCETERA, IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO HAVE MODELS WHERE 
WE CAN STUDY BEHAVIORS AND ONE 
EXAMPLE I LOVE TO SITE IS THE 
PRAIRIE FOLDS WHICH FALL IN LOVE
AND EXHIBIT PAIR BONDING FOR A 
LIFE TIME IS IMPORTANT FOR 
UNDERSTANDING DISEASES AND 
MODELS TO STUDY AGING IN.
CELL TYPE SPECIFIC OMICS ARE 
IMPORTANT.
I THINK RNA SEQ HAS BEEN AT THE 
FOREFRONT AT FIGURING OUT WHAT 
CELLS ARE EXPRESSING WHAT BUT 
PROTEOMICS ARE ALSO GOING TO BE 
IMPORTANT.
CELL TYPE SPECIFIC PROTEOMICS.
LIPID OMICS, METABOLOMICS ARE 
ALL REALLY IMPORTANT.
IF WE HAVE THE DATA WE NEED DATA
ANALYSIS AND SHARING PIPELINES 
TO DECONVOLUTE THE DATA TO FIND 
THE SECRETS THE DATA IS TRYING 
TO TELL US.
REALLY IMPORTANTLY IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO KEEP BRINGING A 
PIPELINE OF SCIENTISTS IN 
TRAINING... THE NIH HAS BEEN A 
HUGE PROPONENT AND PUBLIC 
PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WHICH 
SUPPORT THIS AND ADVOCATES SUCH 
AS JACOBS. TOGETHER, ALL THESE 
THINGS CAN LEAD US TO 
MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS, NEW 
TARGETS, NEW BIO MARKER, 
THERAPIES IN PRECISION MEDICINE.
WITH THAT, I'LL FINISH. 
   &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. HI,
EVERYONE. 
I'M BETH FROST, DIRECTOR OF 
SENSORS FOR ALZHEIMER'S BROWN. I
WILL COVER TWO ISSUES INCLUDING 
MODIFIERS OF FRONTAL TEMPORAL 
DEMENTIA RISK AND ACCELERATING 
THERAPEUTIC DISCOVERY. WE 
RECOMMEND TO DEFINE GENETIC AND 
MOLECULAR MODIFIER OF GENETIC 
AND SPORADIC FTD INCLUDING 
COHORTS OF THE U.S.  POPULATION 
ALONG WITH MOLECULAR AND 
CELLULAR MECHANISMS OF ACTION. 
NEXT SLIDE. SO OVER HALF OF 
FRONTAL TEMPORAL DEMENTIAS ARE 
SPORADIC, MEANING THEY DON'T 
FALL WITHIN A FAMILY THAT IS 
AFFECTED. THERE ARE ABOUT 15% OF
FAMILIAL CASE WHERES WE KNOW S 
/* -- CASES WHERE WE KNOW WHAT 
IS CAUSING THE FTD. THESE ARE 
CAUSED BY THREE MUTATIONS. THIS 
EXPANSION AND C972 MUTATION AND 
PROGRANULIN AND GENE THAT EN 
COALS TA, MAP T, WHICH AFFECTS 
WENDY AND HER GROUP. THEIR GENES
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT CAUSE 
ABOUT -- CONTRIBUTE TO THAT 15% 
OF FTD CAUSED BY A KNOWN 
MUTATION. HOWEVER A BIG CHUNK OF
FAMILIAL CASES ARE DUE TO 
VARIANTS AND MUTATIONS WE DON'T 
KNOW WHAT THEY ARE OR 
POTENTIALLY OTHER FACTORS THAT 
MAY UNDERLIE DEVELOPMENT OF FTD 
WITHIN A CERTAIN FAMILY. SO WE 
NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE 
MUTATIONS ACTUALLY DRIVE DISEASE
AT A MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR 
LEVEL AND UNDERSTAND WHAT CELL 
TYPES ARE AFFECTED BY THESE 
MUTATIONS. DR. GA NICELY COVERED
THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING 
WHENEVER THESE DEPOSIT WHAT CELL
TYPES THEY ARE DEPOSITING IN AND
HOW THAT MIGHT AFFECT 
NEIGHBORING CELLS. SO 
UNDERSTANDING WE ARE EACH A 
CONSTELLATION OF GENES, SOME OF 
WHICH MAY EXACERBATE OR PROTECT 
AGAINST DISEASE-CAUSING 
MUTATIONS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND 
HOW DIFFERENT THE BACKGROUNDS 
AFFECT THE RISK AND RESILIENCE 
FOR INDIVIDUALS CARRYING THESE 
MUTATIONS. GOING THROUGH THE 
SLIDES, AHEAD OF ME THERE, BUT 
FOR -- IN UNDERSTANDING HOW 
GENETIC BACKGROUND AFFECTS RISK 
WE NEED TO KNOW HOW THESE 
MUTATIONS IN DIFFERENT POP LAYS 
AFFECT RISK, AGE OF ONSET AND 
HOW QUICKLY THESE PROGRESS. WE 
NEED TO SUPPORT AND DEVELOP CORE
SERVICES INCLUDING GENE KNOW 
TYPING AND CELLULAR MODELS AND 
BUILD AND SUPPORT COHORTS FOR 
INDIVIDUAL WHO'S CARRY THESE. AN
EXAMPLE HOW THIS WORKS WELCOMES 
FROM THE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
FIELD, MENTIONED IN THE INTRO. 
WHILE MUTATIONS INCREASE 1, 
NORMALLY SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE 
ALZHEIMER'S, A STUDY OF COHORT 
IN COLUMBIA WHO CARRY A MUTATION
THAT WOULD NORMALLY CAUSE 
ALZHEIMER'S FOUND A SUBSET WERE 
RESISTANT TO DEVELOPING 
ALZHEIMER'S, DESPITE CARRY ING 
THAT MUTATION. SO IT WAS 
DISCOVERED THESE PEOPLE CARRY 
THE CHRIST CHURCH MUTATION THAT 
PROTECTS THEM. THIS TYPE -- WE 
NEED MORE THOF WORK IN FRON-- M 
WORK IN FRONTAL TEMPORAL WORK AS
WELL. UNDERSTANDING WHY THERE IS
THIS HUGE FRACTION WHERE THEY 
DON'T RUN IN FAMILIES, OCCUR 
SPORADICALLY, WE NEED TO FOCUS 
ON UNDERSTAND ING WHAT 
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS MIGHT BE 
CONTRIBUTING THERE. NEXT SLIDE 
SO RECOMMENDATION 8 IS PRIORITY 
4 FOCUSING ON PRE-CLINICAL 
DISEASE MODIFYING -- BACK ONE 
SLIDE, I DON'T HAVE IT 
MEMORIZED. IN FRONTAL TEMPORAL 
DEMENTIA BUT DEF RAJING KNOWN 
PATHWAYS OR MECHANISM-AGNOSTIC 
APPROACHES SUCH AS HIGH 
THROUGHPUT SCREENING. WE KNOW 
THE PROTEINS THAT DEPOSIT IN 
FRONTAL TEMPORAL DEMENTIA. THESE
ARE TA, TDP43 AND FUS. THESE ARE
TARGETS WHETHER TAN BO IT /* AN 
UNDERSTANDING OF FACTORS THAT 
MAY CONTRIBUTE TO DEPOSITION OF 
SOME OF THESE PATHOGENIC PREE 
PROTEINS FOR DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE
BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND HOW 
THESE ARE CAUSING NEURAL 
DENEUDENEWURO
DENEURODEGENERATION AND NEEDS TO
UNDERSTAND ACROSS THE SPECTRUM, 
WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT 
INDIVIDUALS ARE MAYBE NOT GOING 
TO BE -- THEY GOING TO NEED 
DIFFERENT DRUGS DEPENDING WHICH 
STAGE THEY ARE IN. WE NEED TO BE
ABLE TO DIAGNOSE PEOPLE AND KNOW
WHERE THEY ARE IN THE SPECTRUM 
SO WE CAN DEVELOP -- GIVE THEM 
THANK YOU, MR. PR
THERAPEUTICS FOR THE STAGE THEY 
ARE IN AND UNDERSTAND HOW THEY 
AFFECT DIFFERENT CELL TYPES, AS 
DR. GAL MENTIONED, NEXT SLIDE. A
EXAMPLE HOW THIS HAS WORKED 
WELL. SO WE AND OTHERS HAVE 
FOUND THAT PATHOGENIC FORMS OF 
TA AND TDP43 DRIVE 
NEURODEGENERATIVE THROUGH 
ACTIVATION OF RETRO TRANSPOSONS,
MAKE UP ABOUT 45% OF THE HUMAN 
GENOME. WHEN THESE ELEMENTS GET 
ACTIVATED THROUGH TA OR TDP43 
THEY ARE TRANSCRIBED INTO RNA, 
SOMETIMES PROTEIN-CODING. THOSE 
PROTEINS CAN ACT TO MAKE A NEW 
COPY OF D.N.A. AND THAT CAN 
INSERT SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE 
GENOME. OVER THE COURSE OF RETRO
TRANSPOSON ACTIVATION THEY CAN 
JUMP, REFERRED TO AS JUMPING 
GENES. THE PRODUCTS MADE OVER 
THE COURSE OF THE ACTIVATION CAN
LOOK LIKE A VIRUS TO THE CELL. 
WE FOUND THAT AN ANTI VIRAL 
NORMALLY PRESCRIBED FOR HIV CAN 
BLOCK THE TRANSCRIPTION OF 
R.N.A. INTO D.N.A. WE FOUND THIS
WAS EFFECTIVE IN TA MODELS, FLY 
MODELS, TEL O 
   
DIFFERENT MOUSE WORKS. WE 
FINISH ED A PHASE 2 TRIAL AT UT 
HEALTH BEFORE I MOVED TO BROWN 
FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE USE ING 
THIS HIV DRUG. A DIFFERENT HIV 
DRUG IS TESTED AT BROWN IN 
ALZHEIMER'S. BECAUSE THIS IS A 
TA-BASED IT CAN BE EXPANDED TO 
NON-ALZHEIMER'S TELOPATHY. A 
RECENT PHASE 2A WAS FINISHED FOR
HIV AND PARTICIPANTS WITH SUPER 
NUCLEAR PAL SI WITH GOOD 
RESULTS. SIMILARLY FINISHED A 
TRIAL IN ALSFTD AND PLANNING FOR
PHASE 3. THOR LIGHTHOUSE TRIAL 
IN ALS HAD NICE RESULTS FROM 
PHASE 2, IN A PHASE 3 OPEN 
ROLLOVER BASED ON RESULTS FROM 
THAT TRIAL. THIS IS ONE EXAMPLE 
OF THERAPEUTICS THAT TARGET 
INFLAMMATION ASSOCIATED WITH 
DEMENTIA AND RECOMMEND OTHER 
POTENTIAL KNOWN TARGETS BE 
PURSUED IN PRE-CLINICAL AND 
CLINICAL STUDIES AS WELL AS 
APPROACHES AGNOSTIC AS HI 
THROUGHPUT COMPOUND SCREENING. 
BACK TO THE ORGANIZERS. 
   &gt;&gt; I JUST WANT TO THAN
TK FTD
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO WERE 
REALLY ESSENTIAL IN DEVELOPING 
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND WHO 
SOUGHT ADVICE OF PATIENT 
POPULATIONS, OF ADVOCATES, OF 
THEIR COLLEAGUES AND THANK YOU 
ALL. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE 
QUESTIONS. 
   &gt;&gt; RAISE YOU HAND IF
YOU'D 
LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION. WE ARE 
MONITORING QUESTIONS COMING IN 
LIVE FROM VIDEO CASTS. OUR FIRST
QUESTION HAS A HAND RAISED, 
GENE. 
   &gt;&gt; YES, THANK YOU SO
MUCH. 
THANK YOU, EVERYONE, FOR 
SPEAKING. I WANT TO ZERO IN ON 
DRUG DISCOVERY AND USE 
THERAPEUTICS TO PREVENT OR TREAT
FTD. THE DOCTOR HAD A NICE CHART
TO CONSIDER THIS. IF WE CONSIDER
THIS, WE SHOULD ALSO REALLY 
CONSIDER THE NOT DRAMATIC AFFECT
OF RELASAL IN ALS. THOSE NOT 
AWARE, 72, MY FAMILY SIMILAR 
PACTED BY, THE MOST COMMON CAUSE
OF GENETIC FTD AND GENETIC ALS. 
IF SOMEBODY HAS BFCT AND GET 
DIAGNOSED ALS THEY WILL BE 
PRESCRIBED (?) AS 
DISEASE-MODIFYING THERAPY. YET 
IF THE CAUSE OF THE DISEASE IS 
CNR72 AND WORKS FOR ALS, WHY 
WOULDN'T IT WORK FOR FTD. IF WE 
ARE CONSIDERING 
DISEASE-MODIFYING THERAPIES WE 
SHOULD -- WHY ARE WE NOT 
CONSIDERING RENASAL. ALSO I SO 
APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S ATTENTION 
THAT THERE'S DRUGS IN TRIAL FOR 
ALS THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL IN FTD.
JUST TO BRING IT BACK, HOW ARE 
WE GOING TO ENSURE THE CRYPTIC 
AXON ANTI OLIOGO NUCLEOTIDE 
THERAPIES IN TRIALS FOR ALS OR 
SOON TO BE IN TRIAL, SHOW AFFECT
IN ADVANCED ALS, HOW WILL WE BE 
SURE THOSE DRUGS MIGHT ONLY WORK
EARLIER IN THE DISEASE AND 
PEOPLE WHO ARE PREDISPOSED TO 
DEVELOPING ALS AND FTD. SO IT IS
NOT JUST THAT WE ARE WILLING TO 
SEE A HOME RUN BUT HOW DO WE 
GUARD AGAINST THESE DRUGS 
WORKING EARLIER IN THE DISEASE 
AND WITH URGENCY BECAUSE IF WE 
DISCARD THOSE THERAPIES WITHOUT 
AFFIRMING THEY MIGHT ONLY WORK 
EARLIER, THEN HOW WILL WE EVER 
KNOW? SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
   &gt;&gt; ADAM, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO 
RESPOND? 
   &gt;&gt; YEAH, WELL THANK
YOU, 
JEAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR MANY 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO EVERYTHING I 
TALKED ABOUT FOR THOSE WHO DON'T
KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN PART OF 
THESE DISCUSSIONS AND COME UP 
WITH MANY FANTASTIC IDEAS WE ARE
TRYING TO INCORPORATE INTO OUR 
FUTURE WORK. I COMPLETELY AGREE 
WITH PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING YOU 
SAID. I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE 
STRENGTH OF THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE 
PARTNERSHIP THAT IS FUNDED 
THROUGH THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES 
OF HEALTH THROUGH ALL FTD, 
THROUGH THE NEW PSP PLATFORM 
TRIAL AND WHAT WE HOPE TO DO 
MORE IN FUTURE BECAUSE TO ANSWER
MANY OF THE THERAPEUTICS 
QUESTIONS THAT YOU BRING UP, WE 
REALLY NEED NOT JUST INDUSTRY 
SUPPORT BUT WE NEED THE NIH TO 
HELP US TO REALLY BRING THESE 
TREATMENTS INTO SCENARIOS THAT 
MAY NOT BE AS ATTRACTIVE TO 
INDUSTRY TO DO ON THEIR OWN. 
THIS IS WHERE THIS PARTNERSHIP 
IS SO IMPORTANT BETWEEN YOU AND 
US AT THE NIH ACADEMIC 
INVESTIGATORS, THE COMMUNITY AND
INDUSTRY SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
   &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF
THERE IS 
ANY -- SORRY, OKAY. SINCE THE 
QUESTION FROM VIDEO CAST IS 
SINCE AM LLOYD PLAQUE AND TA 
NERVE TREATMENTS ONLY PROVIDE 
MODEST SYMPTOM REDUCTIONS WITH 
SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS WHAT GOOD 
COULD THEY DO FOR FTD. 
   &gt;&gt; MAYBELY TAKE THAT
ONE TOO.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SUGGEST AM 
LLOYD TREATMENTS BE USED FOR FTD
BECAUSE THERE IS NO AM LLOYD IN 
FTD. I DON'T AGREE THEY PROVIDE 
MODEST BENEFITS. I THINK FOR THE
RIGHT PEOPLE THEY CAN BE QUITE 
IMPACTFUL. BUT WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO ALLUDE TO IS THE IDEA THAT IN
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE THE NIH 
SUPPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
MANY BIO MARKERS SUCH AS BRAIN 
SCANS AND BLOOD TESTS WE CAN 
USE. THESE ARE VERY INSTRUCTIVE 
FOR US. WE ARE BRINGING THESE 
TECHNOLOGIES INTO FTD. WE THINK 
THAT REGARDLESS ABOUT HOW YOU 
FEEL ABOUT THE ALZHEIMER'S 
THERAPIES, THEY DO PAVE THE WAY 
AND PROVIDE REALLY A ROAD MAP 
THAT WE WILL ACCELERATE THE 
DEVELOPMENTS. 
   &gt;&gt; YOU CAN GO AHEAD
WITH THE 
NEXT QUESTION. I WILL JUST -- 
ONLINE ALREADY -- 
   &gt;&gt; OKAY, GREAT. I THINK
THE 
NEXT QUESTION IS STEVEN HAD HIS 
HAND OUT. 
   &gt;&gt; YEAH, THANKS FOR
ALLOWING 
ME TO ASK ANOTHER ONE. SORT OF 
ON THE TOPIC OF THE LAST FEW 
QUESTIONS. A WAY TO IMPROVE BOTH
IS BRAIN PENETRATION OF DRUG AND
DIFFUSE TO OTHER ORGANS. IS IT 
OF INTEREST TO THIS GROUP TO 
FORMALLY SUPPORT STUDY OF THE 
BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER INCLUDING 
APPLIED IN BASIC RESEARCH SO WE 
CAN WORK ON THAT? 
   &gt;&gt; I DON'T MIND JUMPING
IN 
AND ADDRESSING THAT. SO GLAD YOU
BROUGHT THAT UP. I DID MENTION 
END THEEL YELL CELLS WHICH MAKE 
UP THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER. I 
ALMOST ED THAT IDEA LIKE A 
HELMET SURROUNDING THE BRAIN 
THAT PREVENTED CELLS AND 
BIOLOGICS AND DRUGS FROM GETTING
IN. IN FACT, , THE BARRIER IS 
THE END THEEL YELL CELLS THAT 
HELP. WE KNOW THE BLOOD BRAIN 
BARRIER BECOMES LEAKY AND IS A 
BIG PART OF THIS DISEASE SO IT 
IS CRITICAL TO STUDY BLOOD BRAIN
BARRIER. THERE IS A GREAT LAB AT
STANFORD THAT'S STUDIED THIS IN 
CONTEXT OF BRAIN MUTATIONS. I'M 
ORGANIZING A RESEARCH CONFERENCE
FOR NEXT YEAR ON FRONTAL 
TEMPORAL DEMENTIA. WE ARE 
PUTTING TOGETHER THE PROGRAM 
NOW. ONE OF THE SESSIONS IS 
GOING TO BE DEVOTED TO VASCULAR 
BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER WORK TO LOOK
FORWARD TO ADVANCE ING THAT 
AREA. 
   &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 
   &gt;&gt; CONGRATULATIONS TO
THE 
NDINS AND ALL YOU. I THINK THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAVE COME UP
WITH, I THINK ARE IMPORTANT 
TOUCHSTONES FOR THE FIELD TO BE 
PAYING ATTENTION. THEY ARE JUST 
WELL PUT TOGETHER AND ALSO 
REFLECT THE HOPE THAT COMES FROM
THE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS THAT HAS
BEEN ENABLED LARGELY FROM 
NIH-FUNDED TO ACADEMIC RESEARCH 
CENTERS IN THE UNITED STATES. I 
THINK IT BRINGS SO MUCH HOPE TO 
FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES THEY 
SUPPORT. I NEED TO ASK ONE 
QUESTION WHICH IS FAMILIES WE 
SUPPORT DON'T JUST COME FROM 
COGNITIVE BEHAVE YOUR OR 
NEUROLOGY CLINICS. THE FIELD HAS
DONE SO MUCH WHERE THE NETWORK 
IS TAPPING INTO THE ALZHEIMER'S 
INFRASTRUCTURE, LIKE NICK READ 
FOR EXAMPLE, FOR BIOSAMPLE 
REPOSITORIES AND THE NAC CENTERS
AND ADRCs. OUR PATIENTS AND 
FAMILIES ARE SEEN IN PARKINSON'S
CLINICS AND ALS AND ALZHEIMER'S 
CLINICS, NOT TO MENTION IF THEY 
HAVE BEEN MISDIAGNOSE ED IN 
PSYCHIATRIC CLINICS. A LOT OF 
THE RESEARCH INVOLVES BRINGING 
IN BIOSAMPLES AND UNDERSTANDING 
THE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ALL OF 
THESE DIFFERENT RESEARCH 
NETWORKS TENDS TO HAVE LARGE 
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS 
INDEPENDENT OF ONE ANOTHER AND 
THE FTD FIELD TENDS TO TRY TO 
BRIDGE ACROSS THEM. CAN YOU 
COMMENT ON HOW WE CAN DO BETTER 
AT THAT? IS THIS RELYING ON DATA
SCIENCE AND AI TO FIND WHAT DATA
IS WHERE? IS IT ON THE 
DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, MINIMAL DATA 
SET S SO WE CAN HAVE SOME 
ABILITY COMBINE OR BETTER 
ABILITY TO COMBINE DATA ACROSS 
DISPARATE PLACES? IT IS A HARD 
PROBLEM TO SOLVE BUT FOR FTD 
FAMILIES IT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING
TO NEED. 
   &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, RESA. A
REALLY 
CRITICAL POINT THAT WAS 
SOMETHING THAT CAME UP OVER AND 
OVER IN OUR DISCUSSIONS AROUND 
SORT OF HOW -- TO BREAK DOWN 
BARRIERS, HOW TO INTEGRATE AND I
THINK THE GROUP TRIED TO THINK 
ABOUT THIS IN A FEW WAYS THAT I 
CAN MENTION. ONE IS TO ENCOURAGE
THE USE OF ENGAGEMENT WITH 
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS THAT
HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL FOR DATA
REPOSITORIES AND INTEGRATED 
STUDIES. YOU KNOW, TARGET ALS. 
SO BRIDGING THOSE UNDER SIMILAR 
-- POTENTIALS TO BRING THOSE 
UNDER A SIMILAR PLATFORM HAS THE
POTENTIAL TO CONNECT INDIVIDUALS
AND SAMPLES AND GET AT SOME OF 
THESE QUESTIONS BUT I THINK THIS
IS ALSO WHERE DR. IRWIN TALKED 
ABOUT SORT OF INEXPENSIVE, YOU 
KNOW, BIO MARKERS, TESTS THAT 
CAN BE DONE, ENABLED ACROSS 
DIFFERENT CENTER TYPES. I THINK 
THIS IS AN AREA OF GREAT 
IMPORTANCE. IF ANYONE ELSE WANTS
TO COMMENT, PLEASE DO. 
   &gt;&gt; MAYBE I'LL BRIEFLY
ECHO 
THAT AND SAY THE BIOLOGICAL 
CHARACTERIZATION NOMENCLATURE 
CLASSIFICATION, THOSE EFFORTS I 
THINK WILL HELP ACCELERATE AS 
THE DEMENTIA NOMENCLATURE 
INITIATIVE. ONE OF THE FEEDBACK 
FROM THAT GROUP WAS THAT IN THE 
RESEARCH REALM, REQUESTING 
SAMPLES AND WHAT TERMS WE USE 
CAN SOMETIME BES S BE A BARRIER.
THE MORE WE DEVELOP BIOLOGICAL 
CAN HARMONIZE AND BETTER 
COMMUNICATE ACROSS DISCIPLINES 
OF NEUROLOGY AND OTHER FORMS OF 
MEDICINE AND RESEARCH. 
 
    
   &gt;&gt; SUSAN. 
   &gt;&gt; I WANTED TO FOLLOW
UP. ON 
ALL THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF 
DEMENTIA WE WILL BE DISCUSSING 
OVER THE COURSE OF THIS SUMMIT, 
ALTHOUGH WE DON'T KNOW THE 
PREVALENCE OF FTD, AS YOU 
APPROPRIATELY ADDRESS IN 
RECOMMENDATION, WE CAN BE SURE 
THIS IS PROBABLY, BY FAR, THE 
LEAST PREVIOUS LE PREF /* -- 
PREVALENT. I WANTED TO CALL OUT 
HOW MUCH THE COMMUNITY 
APPRECIATES THE NIH'S INVESTMENT
IN FTD AND HOW WE RECOGNIZE THAT
IT IS STUDIES THAT NIH HAS 
BACKED, ALONG WITH THE PASSION 
OF THIS COMMUNITY. IT HAS LED TO
ADVANCES AND SPECIFICALLY TO 
BIOPHARMA'S ADVANCEMENT IN FTD. 
IT IS GOING TO TAKE, AS YOU HAVE
ALLUDED TO, THE PUBLIC PRIVATE 
PARTNERSHIPS TO GET US THROUGH 
THE FIRST THERAPEUTICSES. A NOTE
OF APPRECIATION FOR ALL-TIME YOU
HAVE PUT IN, AS WELL AS REALLY 
THE DECADES BASIC AND 
TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH THAT HAS 
GOTTEN US AS FAR AS WE ARE. AND 
WILL GET US TO THOSE APPROVED 
THERAPEUTICSES. 
   &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. COMMENTS
OR 
QUESTIONS? 
   &gt;&gt; I HAVE ONE COMMENT
THAT 
CAME IN ONLINE I CAN READ AND 
MAYBE TAKE -- END AND MAYBE TAKE
A TWO-MINUTE BREAK AND TRY TO 
START BACK UP AS QUICK AS WE 
CAN. THERE'S ONE -- I WILL READ 
THIS QUICK. NOT A QUESTION, JUST
COMMENT. FTD IS UNIQUELY CRUEL 
BECAUSE IT OFTEN AFFECTS PERSON 
IN PRIME OF THEIR CAREER AND 
COST OF LOST PRODUCTIVITY, 
INCOME IS HUGELY IMPACTFUL FOR 
FAMILIES, OFTEN BOTH PATIENT AND
CAREGIVER ARE FORCED TO LEAVE 
CAREERS AND STUCK FOR MANY TOR 
YEARS. NIH, HELP US END FTD. 
   &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. BRANDON.
UNMUTE
YOUR CAMERA AND MICROPHONE. 
   &gt;&gt; HE'S OPEN. 
    
   &gt;&gt; MAYBE WHILE BRANDON
IS 
TRYING TO UNMUTE, I JUST WANT TO
TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY AGAIN TO 
THANK THE COMMITTEE AND ALSO 
THE, YOU KNOW, THAT OUR WORK 
COULDN'T BE DONE WITHOUT THE 
PATIENT ADVOCACY GROUPS, PEOPLE 
WITH LIVED EXPERIENCES. 
INCREDIBLE AND POWERFUL AND 
REALLY REVEALING HOW, YOU KNOW, 
HOW REAL THESE -- THIS DISEASE 
IS AND HOW BROAD THE IMPACT IS 
AND HOW URGENT IT IS TO TREAT 
THESE DISEASES. 
   &gt;&gt; I THINK WE WILL TAKE
A 
TWO-MINUTE BREAK AND COME BACK 
WITH THE NEXT SESSION. SORRY, 
BRANDON, FOR TECHNOLOGY NOT 
WORKING FOR YOU. 
   &gt;&gt; WELCOME BACK, A
SHORT 
BREAK. WE ARE ABOUT EIGHT 
MINUTES BEHIND AND TRY TO MAKE 
THAT UP IN THE BREAK. APOLOGIES 
FOR NOT HAVING A LONGER BREAK. 
KRISTIN, ARE YOU ABLE TO TURN ON
YOUR CAMERA? 
   &gt;&gt; I JUST HAD IT ON. DO
YOU 
NOT SEE ME? 
   &gt;&gt; IT MAY BE ON ME
THAT.  IS 
GREAT. I HEAR YOU, THANK YOU. 
   &gt;&gt; GREAT. CAN I GET
STARTED? 
   &gt;&gt; YEP, DEFINITELY. 
   &gt;&gt; GREAT, THANK YOU.
THANK 
YOU EVERYONE FOR STICKING WITH 
US. I KNOW THESE DAYIES CAN FEEL
LONG. I'M SO HONORED TO BE ABLE 
TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO 
SHARE OUR SUBCOMMITTEE'S 
RECOMMENDATION ON POST-TRAUMATIC
BRAIN INJURY NEURODEGENERATION 
AND ALZHEIMER'S AND RELATED 
DISORDERS. I HAVE NO 
DISCLOSURES. WE JUST WANTED TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE USED 
SPECIFIC PROGRAM TO GENERATE 
OTHER FIGURES IN THIS 
PRESENTATION. THIS SLIDE SHOWS A
CONDENSED OVERVIEW OF OUR FOUR 
RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH REALLY 
EMPHASIZED THE NEED TO INVEST IN
INFRASTRUCTURE AND WHAT IS STILL
A RELATIVELY NEW AREA OF 
RESEARCH. WE HAVE MADE SOME 
RAPID ADVANCEMENTS AND TO 
CONTINUE ON THIS TRAJECTORY WILL
REQUIRE INTER DISCIPLINARY 
COLLABORATION ACROSS TBI AND 
DEMENTIA COMMUNITIES, 
MULTI MODAL AND TRANSLATION OF 
KNOWLEDGE INTO CLINICAL SETTINGS
AS WELL AS SHARING KNOWLEDGE. 
TBI IS A MAJOR HEALTH PRIORITY. 
NOTE THAT ALSO TBI IN OLDER 
ADULTS IS EXCEEDING POPULATION 
GROWTH AND MILLIONS OF TRAUMATIC
BRAIN INJURIES ARE NOT COUNTED 
IN THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDING 
INJURIES SUSTAINED IN MILITARY 
COMBAT, THOSE FOR WHICH CARE IS 
NOT SOUGHT OR RECEIVED AND 
INJURIES THAT ARE INTENTIONALLY 
CONCEALED, SUCH AS INJURIES 
SUSTAINED IN CONTEXT OF INTIMATE
PARTNER VIOLENCE. WE WANT TO 
CLARIFY TERMS RELEVANT, SO 
REPETITIVE HEAD IMPACT, RHI 
REFERS TO REPEATED IMPACTS TO 
THE HEAD INCLUDING CONTACT 
SPORTS, PERHAPS SIMILAR TO 
EXPERIENCE ED IN MILITARY BLAST 
EXPOSURE OR IN CONTEXT INVOLVING
PARTNER VIOLENCE. THESE HITS TO 
THE HEAD DO NOT RESULT IN 
SYMPTOMS OF A TRAUMATIC BRAIN 
INJURY. ON THE OTHER HAND 
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY IS AN 
ISOLATED BLOW OR INJURY TO THE 
HEAD OR NECK THAT RESULTS IN 
LOSS OR ALTERATION OF 
CONSCIOUSNESS. NEXT SLIDE. THE 
ACUTE AND CHRONIC SYMPTOMS OF 
TBI CAN RANGE CONSIDERABLY SO 
MOST PEOPLE WITH A MILD TBI 
RECOVER COMPLETELY AND I WILL 
NOTE THAT ONGOING NIH AND NINDS 
EFFORTS TO IMPROVE TDI SEVERITY 
CLASSIFICATION INDICATES IT 
DOESN'T ALWAYS ALIGN WITH TBI 
SEVERITY. MILD TBI HAS BEEN 
ASSOCIATED WITH DEMENTIA RISK IN
SOME STUDIES. NEXT, RHI, WHICH I
SHOULD NOTE IS ALSO PRESENT AND 
-- ADVANCE, THERE WE GO. IS ALSO
PRESENT IN SUBSTANTIAL 
PROPORTION OF PEOPLE WHO 
SUSTAINED A SINGLE TBI, ABOUT 
HALF AND SOME OF OUR STUDIES 
HAVE SUSTAINED EXTENSIVE 
EXPOSURE TO RHI, WHICH DOES NOT 
ITSELF RESULT IN IMMEDIATE 
SYMPTOMS IN MOST CASES BUT 
COMPELLING EVIDENCE DOES SUGGEST
A SUBSET OF THOSE WITH RF RHI 
EXPOSURE DEVELOP DECLINE LATER 
IN LIFE. THIS IS JUST A SNAPSHOT
OF FIVE-YEAR OUTCOMES FROM THE 
NIDLER-FUNDED TBI SYSTEMS WHERE 
YOU CAN SEE AMONG SURVIVORS OF 
MODERATE TO SEVERE TBI, NEARLY A
THIRD DECLINE WITHIN FIVE YEARS,
BUT OVER A QUARTER CONTINUE TO 
IMPROVE. WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS
DRIVING THESE HETEROGENOUS 
CHRONIC TRAJECTORIES. NEXT. 
ANOTHER QUICK NOTE ON KN
NOMENCLATURE AND WORDS WE ARE 
USING IN OUR PRESENTATION TODAY,
WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
POST-TBI, ADRD, ALSO REFERRED TO
AS POST-TRAUMATIC 
NEURODEGENERATION OR PTRD, WE 
ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT ACUTE 
SYMPTOMS THAT HAPPEN AFTER TBI; 
WE ARE REFERRING TO A SUBSEQUENT
PATTERN OF DECLINE THAT IS 
EXPERIENCED FOLLOWING RECOVERY 
IN A SUBSET OF CHRONIC TBI 
SURVIVORS. NEXT SLIDE. THIS 
IMAGE IS FROM A PAPER WE WROTE 
AFTER THE 2019ADRD SUMMIT. I 
HAVE INCLUDED IT BECAUSE IT 
REALLY EMPHASIZES THAT PTND IS 
INDISPUTEDLY A MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY
DEMENTIA. TBI IS ONE OF MANY 
THINGS IN A LIFETIME THAT CAN 
INFLUENCE DEMENTIA RISK. TBI HAS
UNIQUE PATHOLOGICAL FOOT PRINTS 
WE ARE JUST NOW BEGINNING TO 
EXPLORE. JUST BRIEFLY GROWING 
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS HEAD TRAUMA OF
DISTINCT ETIOLOGIES MAY HAVE 
DISTINCT FOOTPRINT S SO CTE HAS 
A WELL-DEFINED LESION THAT 
APPEARS TO BE UNIQUE TO RHI. 
THEN WE HAVE EVIDENCE THAT 
SUGGESTS THAT BLAST EXPOSURE MAY
HAVE A UNIQUE PATTERN OF -- WE 
CALL IT INTER FACE ASTRO GLIAL 
SCARRING. NEXT INTIMATE PARTNER 
VIOLENCE, WHICH IS A PATTERN 
OFTENTIMES OF BRAIN INJURY THAT 
CAN INVOLVE REPETITIVE HEAD 
IMPACTS, AGNOSTIC OR HIGH POHIC 
INJURY IN AN INDIVIDUAL. BASED 
ON VERY FEW CASES STUDIED TO 
DATE. BUT WE HAVE NOT FOUND MUCH
CTE IN IPV, SUGGESTING THIS IS 
NOT A PRIMARY PATHOLOGY OF IPV. 
FINALLY ISOLATED TRAUMATIC BRAIN
INJURY SEEMS TO RESULT IN WIDE 
RANGE OF DISTINCT AND 
OVERLAPPING PATHOLOGIES 
INCLUDING TISSUE TEARS AND NEW 
EVIDENT EVIDENCE IS SUGGESTING 
IT MAY BE AMPLIFIED BY OR 
PROXIMAL TO TRAUMATIC LESIONS. 
NEXT. WE WANT TO ALSO 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE HAD 
TREMENDOUS PROGRESS SINCE EVEN 
JUST THE LAST SUMMIT IN 2022. 
THE NIH HAS FUNDED SEVERAL 
AWARDS TO ADVANCE 
RECOMMENDATIONS WITH A 
PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON 
MULTI MODAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO 
TBI AS A MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY 
DEMENTIA EMPHASIZING 
MULTI DISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION
AND FACILITATING DATA SHARING. 
NEXT. 
   &gt;&gt; TWO MINUTES. 
   &gt;&gt; WE HAVE CHANGED OUR
TIME 
ALLOCATION, JUST SO YOU KNOW. 
NEXT. PRIORITY ONE IS -- I'M 
GOING TO GO THROUGH EACH OF OUR 
PRIORITIES. I'M GOING TO START 
WITH PRIORITY ONE THEN HAVE SOME
SLIDES THAT JUST ILLUSTRATE SOME
OF THE SUB COMPONENTS OF 
PRIORITY ONE. LET'S GO TO THE 
NEXT SLIDE. SO PRIORITY ONE IS 
REALLY ABOUT LONGITUDINAL 
MULTI MODAL STUDIES, THE NEED TO
DEVELOP THIS INFRASTRUCTURE TO 
STUDY THE LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS
OF TBI AND INTERSECTIONS WITH 
ADRDs SO FOUNDATIONAL TO THIS 
EFFORT IS FURTHER VALIDATION AND
STANDARDIZATION OF METHODS TO 
QUANTIFY TBI AND RHI. 
SELF-REPORT IS OFTEN BEST OPTION
FOR LIFETIME EXPOSURE 
CHARACTERIZATION. IDEALLY IT IS 
SUPPLEMENTED BY MEDICAL RECORDS 
WHICH CAN GIVE SNAPSHOTS OF 
INJURIES THAT HAVE RECEIVED CARE
AND EACH HAS STRENGTHS AND 
WEAKNESSES THERE ARE ONGOING 
EFFORTS TO QUANTIFY RHI IN 
CONTACT SPORTS AND MILITARY 
SETTINGS. NEXT. IMPORTANTLY, 
GROWING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS 
READILY REPORTABLE INDICES SUCH 
AS DURATION OF EXPOSURE TO 
CONTACT SPORT S HAVE A DOSE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH FOR EXAMPLE 
CTU NEURAL PATHOLOGY, NEXT. 
OKAY. NEXT. THERE GO. NEXT. SO A
DIAGNOSIS OF POST-TRAUMATIC 
NEURO DEGENERATION DURING LIFE, 
WHEN WE CAN STILL INTERVENE, IS 
OF HIGH PRIORITY. THIS REQUIRES 
LONGITUDINAL STUDY IN COHORTS 
WILLING TO UNDERGO MULTI MODAL, 
CLINICAL AND BIO MARKER 
EVALUATIONS TO DISTINGUISH THE 
STABLE POST TBI SYMPTOMS AND 
CRITERIA UNDERLYING DISEASE 
PROCESSES. NEXT AGAIN TRAUMATIC 
BRAIN INJURY IS AN ADRD RISK 
FACTOR WITH A TIME ZERO WHICH 
MEANS TBI SURVIVORS ARE A RISK 
POPULATION THAT MAY SUPPORT 
IDENTIFICATION OF THE EARLIEST 
BIOLOGICAL SIGNS OF DEMENTIA 
RISK. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO 
RECOGNIZE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS 
WITH RHI EXPOSURE AND WITH TBI 
WILL NOT DEVELOP ADRDs. WE NEED 
ASYSTEMATIC INDIVIDUALS WITH 
THESE EXPOSURES WITH RHI AND T 
BIV TO BE INCLUDED IN OUR 
LONGITUDINAL STUDIES SO WE CAN 
ALSO IDENTIFY PROTECTIVE 
FACTORS. NEXT. WE NEED 
BIO MARKERS OF PTMD. TPI 
BIOMARKER DISCOVERIES HAVE 
FOCUSED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON 
ACUTE CARE TRIAGING. OUR 
COLLEAGUES MEANWHILE WHO ARE 
STUDYING AD AND ADRDs HAVE MADE 
REALLY IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES IN 
IMAGING AND FLUID BIOMARKERS OF 
DEMENTIA SO IN SEARCHING FOR 
BIO MARKERS OF POST TBI ADRD WE 
HAVE FOCUSED SO FAR ON THOSE WE 
KNOW TO BE PERTURBED BY ACUTE 
TBI AND KNOWN RELEVANT TO ADRDs.
WE MAY BE MISSING IMPORTANT PTND
SPECIFIC BIOMARKERS AND NEED TO 
BROAD INTO IDENTIFY OTHER 
NON-INVASIVE BIOMARKERS THAT CAN
PREDICT AND MONITOR DISSEEDS 
PROGRESSION OVER TIME AND 
IDENTIFY THE PATHOLOGIES THAT 
UNDERLIE CLINICAL DECLINE. NEXT.
A GROWING UNDERSTANDING OF 
INJURY BIOMECHANIC NICK S IS 
HELPING US UNDERSTAND HOW 
DIFFERENT TYPES IN HEAD TRAUMA 
CAN RESULT IN PATHOLOGICAL 
PROCESSES. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS
HOW TBI SPECIFIC PATHOLOGIES CAN
INTER ACT WITH AD AND OTHER ADRD
PATHOLOGIES OR WITH CLINICAL 
SYMPTOMS, OR SPECIFICALLY HOW 
ESTABLISHED AD BIO MARKERS ARE 
INFLUENCED BY A TBI. WE NEED TO 
BETTER UNDERSTAND WHETHER HEAD 
TRAUMA INFLUENCES THE RESPONSE 
TO DISEASE MODIFYING TREATMENTS 
WITH EXISTING APPROVED 
THERAPIES. NEXT. FINALLY OUR 
SUBCOMMITTEE HAS EMPHASIZED THE 
IMPORTANCE OF COLLECTING COMMON 
DATA ELEMENTS. CAN WE GO TO THE 
NEXT SLIDE. THERE WE GO. COMMON 
DATA ELEMENTS, SO THIS IS A 
RECOMMENDATION TO INCLUDE 
SIMILAR MEASURES IN STUDIES EVEN
ONGOING STUDIES OF TRAUMATIC 
BRAIN INJURY, WHICH MAY IN SOME 
CASES MEAN COLLECTING ADDITIONAL
DATA TO OPTIMIZE OVERLAP BETWEEN
TBI STUDIES AND DEMENTIA STUDIES
SPECIFICALLY, NEXT, PROVIDE THE 
FOUNDATIONS THAT WE NEED FOR 
CROSS-STUDY COMPARISONS AND DATA
SHARING IN PUBLIC REPOSITORIES. 
I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER NOW TO
MY COLLEAGUE, WHO IS GOING TO 
PRESENT RECOMMENDATION TWO, 
THANK YOU. 
    CAN WE UNMUTE, DR. GRAHAM? 
   &gt;&gt; WONDERFUL, THAT
COMING 
THROUGH? THANKS, I WANT TO THANK
THE ORGANIZERS AT NIH FOR 
PUTTING TOGETHER THIS AND 
BRINGING TOGETHER THESE 
RECOMMENDATIONS, I THINK ARE 
REALLY IMPORTANT. AND, YOU KNOW,
ARE GOING TO BE VERY IMPACTFUL A
MOMENT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR 
FIELD. SO, YOU KNOW, AS WE SET 
OUT WE HAVE MADE A GREAT DEAL OF
PROGRESS SO FAR IN TERMS FROM MY
PERSPECTIVE, BIOMARKERS OF 
INJURY, GAVE ME A MECHANISTIC 
UNDERSTANDING BUT LOTS FOR US TO
DO. IF WE COULD ADVANCE TO THE 
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE .
THE RECOMMENDATION I WANTED TO 
SHARE WITH YOU, WHICH WE HAVE 
PUT TOGETHER, IS ABOUT LINKING 
UP THE ALZHEIMER'S AND TBI 
FIELDS TO GAIN SOME KIND OF 
SCALE AND LEVERAGE EXISTING 
INVESTMENT IN SKILLS, EXPERIENCE
PRESENT IN EACH OF THOSE IN 
ORDER TO HAVE THE SCALE TO KIND 
OF MAKE THE BREAKTHROUGHS 
NECESSARY IF WE ARE GOING TO 
TRANSLATE INTO PATIENT CARE. FOR
EXAMPLE IT IS CLEAR TBI IS A 
VERY HETEROGENOUS DISEASE AND 
UNDERLYING BASIS, FOR INSTANCE, 
NEED LARGE SAMPLE SIZES. THIS IS
WHAT OUR RECOMMENDATION TWO 
FOCUSES ON. I CAN GIVE YOU SOME 
KIND OF DETAIL OF WHAT WE ARE 
GOING TO DO. THE FIRST CHUNK, IF
WE CAN ADVANCE TO THE NEXT 
SLIDE, PLEASE, IS ABOUT 
CONVENING A WORKING GROUP OF 
STAKEHOLDERS FROM TBI AND ADRD 
COMMUNITIES TO EVALUATE EXTENT 
WHAT WE KNOW CAN MR. APPLIED TO 
STUDY OF TBI AND VICE VERSA AND 
DEVELOP A FORUM KNOWLEDGE 
EXCHANGE WHICH WOULD INCLUDE 
BASIC SCIENCE, TRANSLATIONAL AND
CLINICAL RESEARCH, WHICH WOULD 
HOPEFULLY GIVE BIDIRECTIONAL 
COMMUNICATION. I THINK THIS 
WOULD HELP US TO HIGHLIGHT 
CLINICAL DISCOVERIES THAT REVEAL
GAPS WHERE GAINIES CAN BE MADE 
AND HIGHLIGHT BASIC SIZE 
DISCOVERIES THAT MIGHT INFORM 
DEVELOPMENT OF CLINICALLY 
ACCESSIBLE BIOMARKERS AND 
INTERPRETATION OF FACTORS 
RELEVANT TO PATHOLOGY. THIS IS 
DONE YET WE DON'T HAVE SOMETHING
THAT BRINGS TOGETHER THESE 
FIELDS. CERTAINLY WITHIN TBI WE 
HAVE A STRONG INTERNATIONAL 
RESEARCH COMMUNITY THROUGH INBIR
BUT I THINK THERE IS POTENTIALLY
MORE THAT CAN BE DONEN. SOME 
WAYS THIS IS LOW HANGING FRUIT 
ABOUT WORKING TOGETHER. IF WE 
COULD HAVE THE NEXT SLIDE, THE 
SECOND SUBPART OF THIS 
RECOMMENDATION IS AROUND, YOU 
KNOW, HARMIZATION. WHAT WOULD WE
NEED TO DO TO ACHIEVE THESE KIND
OF GAINS. YOU KNOW, WE STRONGLY 
PROMOTE HARMONIZATION OF 
EXISTING DATA THAT'S ALREADY 
BEEN DONE INCLUDING DATA IN 
FEDERAL REPOSITORIES FOR 
RIGOROUS AND REPRODUCIBLE 
RESEARCH. THAT MAY MEAN DATA 
STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT HARMIZATION
AND ESTABLISHING SPECIFIC CODE 
BOOKS, FUNDING USABILITY STUDIES
TO SIMPLIFY AND SHARING 
REQUIRING PROSPECTIVE DATA 
COLLECTION USING STANDARDIZED 
ELEMENTS AND MINIMUM DATA 
ELEMENTS, IMPORTANT FROM OUR 
PERSPECTIVE. LAST IS ABOUT 
FOSTERING COLLABORATION. 
SPECIFICALLY TO BUILD TOWARDS 
THE GOAL OF GAINING REGULATORY 
SUPPORT FOR DIAGNOSTICS AND 
ASSESSMENT METHODS, LOOKING AT 
SAFETY AND EFFICACY IN CLINICAL 
TRIALS. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE 
WANT BETTER COLLABORATION BUT WE
WANT TO DO SO WITH A VERY CLEAR 
PURPOSE THAT WE ARE AIMING 
ULTIMATELY TO OVER COME BARRIERS
THE FIELD HAS HAD TOWARD 
DEVELOPING NEW THERAPEUTICSES. 
WE ARE HOPING THAT, YOU KNOW, 
KIND OF PRECISION DIAGNOSTIC 
APPROACH TO PATIENTS THAT IS 
GOING TO YIELD SUCCESS IN 
TRIALS. SO THAT WRAPS UP 
RECOMMENDATION NUMBER TWO TO OUR
NEXT PRESENTER, THANK YOU. 
   &gt;&gt; YES, GOOD MORNING. I
TOO 
WOULD LIKE TO ECHO MY THANKS TO 
NINDS AND NIH IN GENERAL, 
CERTAINLY ALL THE SUBCOMMITTEE 
MEMBERS I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE
OF WORKING WITH. I HAVE THE 
PRIVILEGE OF INTRODUCING 
RECOMMENDATION 3. IF I COULD 
HAVE THE NEXT SLIDE. I HAVE 
NOTHING TO DISCLOSE. NEXT SLIDE.
NEXT SLIDE, THANK YOU. SO 
RECOMMENDATION 3 REALLY IS TO 
CROSS-LINK MODELS AND CONDUCT 
BASIC AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
WITH HUMAN SPECIMENS AND 
EXPERIMENTAL MODELS FOR THE POST
TISSUE RESPONSE, IE IDENTIFY 
MECHANISTIC PATHWAYS AND 
ELUCIDATE PATHWAYS AGAINST 
PROGRESSION OF POST TBI, ADRDs. 
UNDERNEATH THIS RECOMMENDATION 
WERE SORT OF THE FIVE SUB 
RECOMMENDATIONS, IF YOU WILL. I 
WILL TOUCH ON THAT BRIEFLY AS WE
GO THROUGH THIS TALK. NEXT 
SLIDE, PLEASE. I JUST WANTED TO 
REMIND EVERYONE THAT POST TBI 
AND ITS PROGRESSION TO ADRD IS A
CONTINUUM. THE LEFT PANEL IS 
SUMMARY, ALBEIT A LITTLE 
SIMPLIFIED, OF HOW A TBI MIGHT 
THEN SLOWLY SPIRAL DOWN TO 
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT TYPE 
PATHOLOGY AND KEY WORDS ARE 
AD-LIKE PATHOLOGY BUT IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THIS LITTLE 
SCHEMATIC INCLUDES FEATURES 
PREVALENT IN AD, INCLUDING BETA 
AM LLOYD, VASCULAR DIGITAL ET 
CETERA. EMERGING EVIDENCE IN THE
FIELD INCLUDING THIS MANUSCRIPT 
FROM GRAHAM AND COLLEAGUES IN 
2023, WHERE IN THE TOP PANEL YOU
CAN SEE BRAIN REGIONS THAT ARE 
IMPACTED, BOTH GRAY MATTER, 
WHITE MATTER, CSF, IMPACTS A 
LARGE SWATH OF VARIOUS BRAIN 
REGIONS. IN THE MIDDLE PANEL YOU
CAN SEE TBI SIMILARLY HAS OTHER 
REGIONS ALSO CO -EMERGED AS WITH
THE ADRD PATIENT SUGGESTING 
THERE ARE POTENTIAL COMMON 
MECHANISMS. HOWEVER AS THESE 
PROCESSES ARE DIFFERENT BETWEEN 
THE TBI AND ADRD AND THEY ARE 
DISTINCT BUT IT IS ALSO 
IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY THAT 
CONSIDERABLE OVERLAP EXISTS. 
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE. AS NOTED 
EARLIER, AS NOTED EARLIER BY DR.
OH C OH CONNOR, SOME HAVE BEEN 
FUNDED. THIS IS A NEW HOPE TBI 
STUDY, WHERE THEY ARE EXPANDING 
A LARGE NETWORK OF WELL 
CHARACTERIZED BRAIN DONORS 
LOOKING AT NEURAL IMAGING, 
BEHAVIORAL MEASURES AND 
IDENTIFYING SIGNATURES FROM 
THESE DATA TYPES, INCLUDING 
QUANTITATIVE NEURO PATHOLOGY TO 
BETTER INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH 
AND ONGOING TREATMENTS FOR 
PATIENTS INCLUDING VASCULAR 
PATHOLOGY. THE END GOAL, OF 
COURSE, IS TO PROVIDE A 
LONG-TERM REPOSITORY THAT 
RESEARCHERS AND CLINICIANS CAN 
NOW START TO VACCINATE FUTURE 
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS. IF I CAN 
HAVE THE NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE. SO 
THE NEXT RECOMMENDATION, ONE OF 
THE SUB RECOMMENDATIONS WAS 
REALLY TO START TO STRENGTHEN 
THIS LINKAGE OF HUMAN SPECIMENS 
TO CHARACTERIZE POST TBIADRD. IN
THIS SUMMARY FROM SMITH AND ALL,
THIS REVIEW PAPER, WHERE YOU 
HAVE SINGLE TO MODERATE SEVERE 
TBI OR REPETITIVE T BIV,TBI, WH 
STRENGTHENED INCLUDING TA, 
INFLAMMATION, A BETA, LONG-TERM 
DEVELOPMENT OF ATROPHY. IN LATE 
EFFECTS OF TBI STUDIES, WHERE 
THEY ARE DOING HIGH RESOLUTION 7
TESLA ANATOMICAL IMAGING, 
COMBINING THAT WITH VARIOUS 
NEURO PA LOGICAL STAINS AND 
SHOWN HERE IN C, YOU CAN SEE A 
VASCULAR STRUCTURE SURROUNDED BY
A BETA STAINING, SUGGESTING A 
VASCULAR ETIOLOGY, SO 
CHARACTERIZING THESE IN MORE 
DETAIL IS CERTAINLY A HIGH 
RECOMMENDATION OF THIS 
SUBCOMMITTEE. NEXT SLIDE, 
PLEASE. OF COURSE THE EVALUATION
OF -- NEXT SLIDE. THE EVALUATION
OF CLINICALLY RELEVANT ANIMAL 
MODELS THAT MAY ACCELERATE ADRD 
IS VERY IMPORTANT. IN THE LEFT 
PANEL HERE YOU CAN SEE SORT OF 
CLASSICAL INDUCTION MODELS OF 
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND 
INCLUDING HERE IN THE MIDDLE 
REPEATED HEAD INJURY OR CLOSE 
HEAD INJURY. MANY OF THESE ARE 
USED TO STUDY THE ACUTE TYPE OF 
TBI BUT NOW WE ARE STARTING TO 
BE USED TO STUDY LONG-TERM 
EVENTS IN TBI. THE USE OF 
ENCEPHALOPHIC MODELS, STUDIES 
OVER 16 WEEKS IN A FERRET MODEL,
ONE CAN SEE INCREASING 
FRACTIONAL SIGNATURES STARTING 
TO EMERGE, PARTICULARLY AT THE 
GRAY MATTER WHITE MATTER 
BOUNDARIES IN THESE. SO 
DEVELOPMENT OF THESE MODELS AND 
FOLLOWING THEM OVER LONG-TERM 
LIFE SPAN STUDIES IS VERY 
IMPORT
IMPORTANT. A FINAL 
RECOMMENDATION IS IDENTIFY MORE 
CLEARLY FACTORS THAT CAN CONFER 
RESILIENCE SUSCEPTIBILITY AFTER 
TBI. MOST IMPORTANTLY, USE THOSE
FACTORS TO GUIDE PATIENT CARE. 
SO IN THE VIN DIAGRAM ON THE 
LEFT YOU CAN SEE PRE-INJURY, 
FACTORS INCLUDING GENETIC 
SUSCEPTIBILITY, INJURY RELATED 
FACTORS SUCH AS SEVERITY AND 
LOCATION, POST INJURY AND MOST 
IMPORTANTLY POST INJURY FACTORS 
SUCH AS CO. MORBID DEFICITS AND 
REHABILITATIONS ALL CAN GUIDE 
OUR CARE AND IDENTIFY BETTER 
WAYS TO TREAT PATIENTS. IN THE 
SCHEMATIC FROM 2022 THEY 
ACKNOWLEDGE WE HAVE MADE GREAT 
PROGRESS IN BIOMARKERS AND MRI 
FOR TRIAGING AND UNDERSTANDING 
PROGRESSION AND MANAGEMENT OF 
TBI. AS THEY ALSO POINT OUT 
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT GAPS, 
PARTICULARLY IN HOW TO TREAT 
OLDER POPULATIONS OF WHICH FORM 
A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF TBI 
PATIENTS. SO THESE 
RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUB 
RECOMMENDATIONS REALLY ARE TO 
GUIDE ENHANCE BASIC AND 
TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH TO 
ELUCIDATE MECHANISMS AND 
TREATMENT TARGETS FOR POST TBI, 
ADRD. WITH THAT I WILL HAND IT 
OVER THE MY OTHER COLLEAGUES. 
   &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T HEAR YOU. I
SEE 
-- MONIQUE, YOU HEAR SNUS WE 
CAN'T HEAR YOUF YOU ARE TRYING 
TO USE YOUR MICROPHONE. 
   &gt;&gt; CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
   &gt;&gt; IT IS VERY QUIET.
ADJUST. 
   &gt;&gt; BETTER? 
   &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 
   &gt;&gt; GREAT. JUST WANTED
TO ECHO
JUST THANKING NINDS AND NIH FOR 
THIS OPPORTUNITY. THE NEXT 
SLIDE, PLEASE. NO DISCLOSURES. 
( POOR AUDIO) 
   &gt;&gt; FOR THIS FOURTH 
RECOMMENDATION THE POINT WE WANT
TO BEIPOINT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT TS
YEARS FOR SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES
AND ADVANCES TO BE IMPLEMENTED, 
SO WE ACKNOWLEDGE WE NEED TO BE 
ABLE TO SHARE INFORMATION. 
THERE'S CHALLENGES WITH BEING 
ABLE TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE AND 
INFORMATION TO ALL INTER TESTED 
PARTIES, ESPECIALLY INDIVIDUALS 
WHO WOULD RECEIVE SUCH 
INFORMATION SUCH AS PEOPLE WITH 
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AS WELL 
AS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY. WE 
HAVE FOUR SUB RECOMMENDATIONS 
RELATED TO THIS TOPIC. THIS IS 
ABOUT DIVERSIFYING -- HAVING A 
DIVERSE TEAM, ADVANCING 
FINDINGS, MAKING SURE THERE IS 
SHARING TO OPTIMIZE ENGAGEMENT 
WITH RESEARCH AND MAXIMIZE 
CLINICAL TRANSLATABILITY. NEXT 
SLIDE, PLEASE. SO FOR THIS FIRST
SUB RECOMMENDATION, AGAIN, TO 
THE LEFT IS THIS IDEA OF MAKING 
SURE WE HAVE ALL INTERESTED 
PARTIES THAT ARE INCLUDED, 
ESPECIALLY INDIVIDUALS WITH 
LIVED EXPERIENCES AND THEIR 
FAMILY. YOU KNOW , THE PRINCIPAL
OF NOTHING ABOUT US WITHOUT US, 
MAKING SURE THEY ARE INCLUDED IN
EVERY PROCESS, FROM PLANNING, 
IMPLEMENTATION, AS WELL AS 
DISSEMINATION OF SUCH RESEARCH 
AND INCLUDING OTHER INDIVIDUALS 
AT THE TABLE, RIGHT. CLINICIAN, 
RESEARCHERS, ADDITIONAL 
COMMUNITY PARTNERS. AND, OF 
COURSE W THE NEW FIELD OF 
IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE, YOU 
KNOW, INCLUDING IMPLEMENTATION 
SCIENTISTS IN ORDER FOR US TO BE
ABLE TO DEVELOP AND CREATE, 
CO -CREATE SIGNATURE ROUSE 
RESEARCH, TO REDUCE THIS BURDEN 
OF POST-TBI, ADRD. SO NO LONGER 
WORKING IN SILOS. TO THE RIGHT, 
THE POINT TO EMPHASIZE IS AFTER 
HAVING A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY 
THERE COULD BE SINGLE TRAUMATIC 
BRAIN INJURY THAT IS SEVERE. 
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A VARIETY OF
DIFFERENT PATHWAYS OR -- THAT 
CAN HAPPEN AFTER AN INJURY. THEN
FROM RESILIENCE WHERE 
INDIVIDUALS MAY BE -- RESUME 
BACK TO FULL RECOVERY, WHEREAS 
OTHERS MAY EXPERIENCE 
PROGRESSIVE NEURO DEGENERATION. 
AT THE LOWER END IS RELATED TO 
INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY HAVE 
REPEATED MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN 
INJURIES. SO WHAT IS REALLY AS 
IMPORTANT IS WE HAVE TO 
CO -CREATE OPPORTUNITIES AND 
INTERVENTIONS AND PROGRAMMING TO
HELP HOW CAN WE PREVENT OR AT 
LEAST DELAY THE PROGRESSION OF 
POST TBIADRD. NEXT SLIDE. 
   &gt;&gt; TWO MINUTES. 
   &gt;&gt; THEN IN THE SECOND 
SUBCOMMITTEE SETUP 
RECOMMENDATION IS ABOUT 
INCLUDING ALL OF THE DIFFERENT 
TYPES OF RESEARCH, FROM 
PRECLINICAL TO CLINICAL, BOTH IN
THE ADRD AND TBI SPACES AND 
USING THESE -- THIS KNOWLEDGE TO
BE ABLE TO DEVELOP, VALIDATE, 
TRANSLATE AND OBVIOUSLY 
IMPLEMENT INTO CLINICAL 
PRACTICE, USING DIFFERENT TYPE 
OF DIAGNOSTIC APPROACHES AND 
HOLISTIC INTERVENTIONS SO WE 
CAN, AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, BE 
ABLE TO PREVENT OR DELAY 
POST-TBIADRD. NEXT SLIDE. THEN 
THE THIRD SUB RECOMMENDATION, 
RIGHT, IS, AGAIN, CREATING THIS 
SPACE, RIGHT, A PRECOMPETITIVE 
SPACE WHERE YOU HAVE A VARIETY 
OF DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS THAT 
ARE COLLABORATING, SHARING 
KNOWLEDGE, TRYING TO IDENTIFY 
SOLUTIONS, SHARING DATA. YOU 
KNOW, HELPING TO GUIDE DIFFERENT
METHODOLOGIES OR DEVELOPMENTS 
AND JUST ENCOURAGING THIS SPACE 
WITH NUMEROUS REGULATORY 
PARTNERS, INDUSTRY PARTNERS, 
HOSPITAL CLINICIANS, PEOPLE WITH
LIVED EXPERIENCE, MAKING SURE 
EVERYONE IS AT THE TABLE TO BE 
ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE AND HELP US 
WITH PROMOTING THE INNOVATION 
AND FURTHER DEVELOPING NEW 
TECHNOLOGIES OR METHODOLOGIES 
AND TREATMENTS EARLY BY WORKING 
TOGETHER TO SOLVE SUCH PROBLEMS.
NEXT SLIDE. THEN I WILL ITERATE 
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TRANSLATE 
OUR FINDING INTO CLINICAL 
PRACTICE, HOW DO WE DO THAT. HOW
DO WE SHARE IN THE BEST WAY TO 
SHARE INFORMATION. BOTH 
RECIPROCAL, RIGHT, INDIVIDUALS 
THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED 
XHEE 
EXPERIENCE MAY SUPPORT THE 
RESEARCH PROCESS AND PROMOTE 
FURTHER ENGAGEMENT. INCLUDING A 
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PARTNERS, 
SPECIAL INSTITUTIONAL
THOSE WITH THE BRAIN INJURY 
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA AGAIN NOT
WORKING IN SILOS BUT WORKING 
TOGETHER WITH A VARIETY OF 
DIFFERENT PARTNERS ENSURING THAT
WE HELP PROMOTE AND SHARE THE 
KNOWLEDGE AND ALL THE FINDINGS 
THAT WE HAVE BASED OFF THE 
RESEARCH THAT WE'RE DOING AND 
THAT MAKES THE RESEARCH, BETTER,
RIGHT.
HOW CAN WE ENGAGE ALL 
INDIVIDUALS IN THE PROCESS TO 
HELP IMPROVE CLINICAL PRACTICE 
AS WELL AS INFORM -- MAKING SURE
INDIVIDUALS ARE AT THE RECEIVING
END AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE 
ARE DIVERSE INDIVIDUALS.
SO JUST INCLUDING A VARIETY OF 
DIFFERENT INTERESTED PARTIES OR 
STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PROCESS.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MONIQUE AND 
EVERYONE TO PARTICIPATED ON THE 
SUBCOMMITTEE.
WE HAVE A FEW MINUTES NOW FOR 
DISCUSSION.
&gt;&gt; WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE
LATE 
SO WE'LL HAVE 15 MINUTES FOR 
DISCUSSION.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.
AMBER, I CAN'T SEE HANDS RAISED 
SO IF YOU DO -- 
&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW I DO NOT SEE
HANDS 
RAISED.
LET ME CHECK VIDEOCAST.
&gt;&gt; I SEE PENNY.
PENNY ARE YOU ABLE TO UNMUTE?
&gt;&gt; WORKING ON IT.
TOOK A MINUTE.
SORRY.
YOU GUYS HAVE DONE A WONDERFUL 
JOB.
THANK YOU FOR PULLING THIS 
TOGETHER.
MY QUESTION IS THERE WERE A 
COUPLE TIMES IN THE DISCUSSION 
WHERE IT HEARD THE REFERENCE 
BETWEEN  TBI AND ALZHEIMER'S AND
A KNOWLEDGE SHARING BETWEEN THE 
TBI AND ALZHEIMER'S FIELD AND 
YET TBI IS NOT JUST RELATED TO 
ALZHEIMER'S IT'S RELATED TO THE 
COMPLEX IDEOLOGY AND BEHIND 
HAVING NOT JUST ALZHEIMER'S BUT 
ALSO THE PLACE WHERE FTD AND ALS
IS WELCOME.
WELCOME HOW THE TBI FIELD AND 
HOW YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE 
THINKING ABOUT THE HOLISTIC 
CAUSES OF DEMENTIA AND HOW HEAD 
IMPACT AND TBI AND FORGIVE ME 
BECAUSE I'M PROBABLY GET YOUR 
TERMINOLOGY LONG, I KNOW IT'S 
COMPLICATED.
HOW DO THEY RELATE TO DIFFERENT 
FORMS OF DEMENTIA?
I'LL STOP.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, PENNY.
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
IT ACKNOWLEDGES THE EVOLUTION OF
SCIENCE IN THE SPACE.
FOR DECADES WE WERE ALL TAUGHT 
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY WAS THE 
GREATEST ENVIRONMENTAL RISK 
FACTOR FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
IN PARTICULAR.
IN THE ENSUING DECADES WE HAVE 
COME TO APPRECIATE THAT WE 
ACTUALLY DO NOT SEE ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE NEUROPATHOLOGY AS 
COMMONLY AS WE WOULD HAVE 
EXPECTED IF THAT WERE 
EXCLUSIVELY TRUE.
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND 
POST-TRAUMATIC BRAIN IS A 
DEMENTIA AND INHERENT THAT A 
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY IS ONE OF
LIFE EXPOSURES OVERLAID TO OTHER
EXPOSURES THAT MAY HAVE IMPACTED
DEMENTIA RISK IN A GIVEN 
INDIVIDUAL.
DR. GRANT, IT WOULD BE GREAT IF 
YOU'D BE WILLING TO TOUCH ON 
THIS TOO.
I KNOW WE SPENT TIME THINKING 
THROUGH THIS IN OUR MEETINGS ON 
THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING 
HOW A NEW ONSET TRAUMATIC BRAIN 
INJURY MY IMPACT DISEASES AND 
DIAGNOSES AND USE OF EXISTING 
TREATMENT.
&gt;&gt; THANKS FOR THE
QUESTION.
IT'S THE QUESTION AND I DON'T 
WANT TO OVEREMPHASIZE THE LINK.
THERE'S A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF A
COMMUNITY THAT WORKS WELL AND 
THEY COVER LOTS OF ETIOLOGIES.
WE NEED TO BE TALKING TO A VERY 
WIDE RANGE OF SPECIALIST GROUPS 
AND TRYING TO BRIDGE ACROSS 
THESE BECAUSE THERE ARE 
INTERESTING AND SCIENTIFICALLY 
INFORMATIVE OVERLAPS BETWEEN 
WHAT YOU SEE AND TBI.
IT TOUCHES ON OUR IGNORANCE OF 
THE GENERAL HIGH LEVEL THINGS 
LIKE AGING.
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT TBI DOES TO 
YOUR NEURODEGENERATIVE 
TRAJECTORY AND MIGHT ACCELERATE 
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ANYWAY.
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE
AND WE'RE THINKING INCREASINGLY 
OPEN MINDED AND IT'S CHALLENGING
AS A CONDITION TO TREAT BECAUSE 
CO-PATHOLOGY IS SO COMMON OR 
POLY PATHOLOGY AND IN THE 
SPORTING CONTEXT THERE'S A GREAT
DEAL OF TALK WITH CTE AND IT'S 
ALMOST A BRANDING 
 BUT OF COURSE WE INCREASINGLY 
RECOGNIZE CO-PATHOLOGIES ARE 
EXTREMELY COMMON AFTER HEAD 
IMPACTS AND EVEN IF YOU WERE TO 
TREAT THE CTE PATHOLOGY IN ALL 
THOSE GROUPS THEN YOU'D PROBABLY
FIND THERE'S STILL A GREAT DEAL 
OF DEMENTIA VARIANTS KIND OF 
UNTREATED.
IT'S A GREAT CONDITION I'D ARGUE
TO MEASURE INFLAMMATION AND 
PATHOLOGY AND TARGETING 
DIFFERENT THINGS BUT WORKING AT 
AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL WHAT'S 
HAPPENING.
THAT'S MY TAKE ON IT BUT THERE'S
LOTS OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE 
DONE.
&gt;&gt; I WORK FOR THE
ASSOCIATION 
FRONTOTEM
FRONTOTEMPORAL DEGENERATION AND 
HEAD IMPACT WAS UP BUT LITTLE IS
KNOWN FROM IT BUT FROM A 
THEORETICAL SIDE THAT NO REASON 
TO THINK IT WOULDN'T HAVE A 
SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP.
&gt;&gt; IT'S IMPORTANT TO
RECOGNIZE 
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE STRIVING
TO FY WHAT ARE THE UNIQUE 
PATHOLOGIES OF DISTINCT IT HEAD 
TRAUMA EXPOSURES SUB TYPES AND 
HOW DO THEY INTERACT WITH THE 
PATHOLOGIES OF BETTER KNOWN 
ADRDs?
THIS IS THE HALLMARK OF WHAT 
WE'RE TRYING TO PRIORITIZE 
ACROSS OUR RECOMMENDATIONS.
AND WE ALSO TRY TO EMPHASIZE 
THAT RECOGNIZE THE RELATIVE 
INFANCY OF OUR RESEARCH AND THIS
HAS BEEN STUDIED FOR CENTURIES.
AND SO WE WANT TO LEARN FROM OUR
COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE BEEN AT IT 
LONGER AND USE THE TREMENDOUS 
WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE AS
A STARTING POINT AND CONTINUE 
COLLABORATION SO WE CAN 
ACCELERATE KNOWLEDGE AS QUICKLY 
AS POSSIBLE.
I SEE A QUESTION FROM NICOLE 
BR --BJORKLUND.
&gt;&gt; WHEN WE KNOW ABOUT THE 
PARTNER VIOLENCE AND WE DON'T 
KNOW WHAT THE IMPACT OF THAT IS 
COMPREHENSIVELY BUT ONE QUESTION
I HAD WAS CONSIDERING WHAT 
YOU'RE STUDYING IT SEEMS LIKE 
THERE SHOULD BE MORE WORK WITH 
THE AND DOD, ARE THERE 
POSSIBILITIES OF INCORPORATING 
OR MESHING WITH THEM IN TERMS OF
DATA AND BIO SPECIMENS?
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE HAVE SOMEONE
TO 
SPEAK TO THIS.
 
&gt;&gt; EVERYTHING WE DO IS IN 
PARTNERSHIP AND WITH NINDS AND 
DOD AND V.A. AND DR. HOFFMAN IS 
A WORKING MEMBER ON THIS 
COMMITTEE.
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD 
TOO.
 
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE ON MUTE.
DOES SOMEONE NEED TO ENABLE YOUR
MICROPHONE.
&gt;&gt; NOW IT'S ON.
EVERYONE CAN HEAR ME?
&gt;&gt; YES.
&gt;&gt; YEAH.
THE LONG-TERM ISSUES IS A 
PRIORITY FOR THE V.A. BECAUSE 
UNLIKE DOD AROUND MANY OF THE 
HOSPITAL SYSTEMS OUT THERE, WE 
DON'T TREAT ACUTE TBI.
WE GET THE PERSON AFTER THEY 
HAVE HAD LIFE TIME BRAIN 
INJURIES.
SO WE TRY TO WORK BACK THAT.
WE HAVE TWO LONGITUDINAL STUDIES
THAT ARE ONGOING.
ONE IS STARTING FROM 2010 AND 
THE OTHER ABOUT 2013 THE V.A. IS
NOW GOING TO CARRY IT ON FOR THE
FORESEEABLE FUTURE.
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY HARMONIZING 
THE DATA BETWEEN THE TWO THAT 
WILL HELP US TO UNDERSTAND 
CRITICAL BIOMARKERS FOR 
DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES AND PERHAPS 
ALLOW US TO EVEN APPROACH HOW TO
MAYBE DEVELOP TREATMENTS THAT 
ARE MECHANISTIC IN THE FUTURE 
FOR SOME OF THESE MORE 
PROGRESSIVE PROCESSES.
LIKE YOU ASKED, IT IS A MAJOR 
PRIORITY AND WE DO COLLABORATE 
ESPECIALLY AT POLY TRAUMA 
CENTERS COLLABORATE WITH THE TBI
MODEL SYSTEMS AND SO OUR MODEL 
SYSTEM IS CONSIDERS THE CIVILIAN
VERSION A CRITICAL PARTNER WE'VE
BEEN TEAMING UP WITH WELL OVER 
10 YEARS.
THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART, TBI 
AS CMS, CENTERS FOR MEDICAID -- 
SORRY, I DON'T REMEMBER ALL THE 
CMS INITIALS.
I'M FORGETTING ON THE SPOT HERE,
BUT THEY HAVE NOW RECOGNIZED 
SOMETHING THAT THE V.A. HAS 
RECOGNIZED SINCE 2011 THAT TBI 
IS A CHRONIC CONDITION.
SO WE IN OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS 
AND NIH AND DOD, THIS ASPECT IS 
A HIGH PRIORITY SO THANK YOU FOR
THE QUESTION.
&gt;&gt; THANKS.
I ALSO WANTED TO ADD THAT WE 
HAVE THE BIO REPOSITORY WHERE 
WE'RE NOW LINKING THE TISSUE AND
FLUIDS BIO SAMPLES WITH THE DATA
FROM THE CLINICAL STUDIES AS 
WELL AS THE BRAIN BANKS.
SO THERE'S DEFINITELY A LOT OF 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT WE 
GET WHEN WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE
COALITION OF ALL THE DATA AND 
WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE HOW THINGS 
WILL MOVE FORWARD AND I ALSO 
WANTED TO GIVE TIME FOR SARAH 
FONTANE THE DOD PARTNER, IF YOU 
HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD.
&gt;&gt;  I WANTED TO ADD IN
THAT 
THERE'S OFTEN A STIGMA THE DOD 
WORKS WITH AND WHILE THERE CAN 
BE, THERE'S MANY RESEARCHERS 
WITHIN THE DOD WILLING TO WORK 
ON THIS LONG TERM EFFECT OF WHAT
IS HAPPENING WITH THE TISSUES, 
WITH THE BIO SAMPLES WE HAVE 
BANKED.
WE'VE GOT COLLABORATIVE FOLKS.
THE WHOLE POINT IS TO LOOK AT 
THE DEGENERATION AND RELATED 
DEMENTIAS BECAUSE WE SIMPLY 
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION IN
THE AREA OF THE FIELD TO BE ABLE
TO DISTINGUISH WHAT, IF ANY, IS 
THE LIKELY POST TBI PATHOLOGY 
WE'LL END UP WITH WE'RE 
INCLUSIVE THERE BUT THERE'S A 
WHOLE RESEARCH PROGRAM THAT I 
MANAGE THAT FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON
THAT.
SO, THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE
MORE 
THING.
THE V.A. ALSO THROUGH THE WORK 
OF DR. PUGH HAS A DATA SET FOR 
VETERANS GOING BACK TO THEIR 
MILITARY SERVICE AND THAT NUMBER
IS ABOUT OVER 2 MILLION.
AROUND AND LOOKING AT THEIR 
HEALTH CURRENTLY.
WHETHER IT'S DEMENTIA OR OTHER 
ASPECTS OF BRAIN HEALTH, WE HAVE
THAT MILITARY DATA SET THAT'S 
AVAILABLE.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU ALL.
YOU CAN SEE OUR SUBCOMMITTEE IS 
LUCKY TO HAVE OUR FEDERAL 
COLLEAGUES WEIGH IN AND NICOLE, 
GREAT QUESTION, THAT ALLOWS US 
TO UNDER SCORE THE THEME ACROSS 
OUR RECOMMENDATION WE NEED TO 
BREAK DOWN BARRIERS AND 
COLLABORATE AND WORK ACROSS 
AGENCIES.
THANK YOU FOR THAT.
I SEE IAN KREMER.
&gt;&gt; I APOLOGIZE IF I MISSED
THIS 
BUT I LOST CONNECTIVITY EARLIER 
IN THE TALK.
DO THE RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS 
ADDRESS ONE OR BOTH OF THE 
FOLLOWING POSSIBILITIES.
ONE IS LOOKING AT OTHER FORMS OF
DEMENTIA THAT HAVE HIGH INCI
INCIDENTS OF FALLS AS POTENTIAL 
DRIVERS OF TBI AND THEREFORE AS 
RISK REDUCTION POSSIBILITIES AND
THE OTHER IS THE RESEARCH 
RECOMMENDATIONS ADDRESS 
OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLABORATE 
WITH THE INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH 
COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY COUNTRIES
WITH EXTENSIVE HISTORIES DURING 
WARTIME TO STUDY TBI IN THE 
NON-U.S.-BASED POPULATIONS.
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION
AND 
KEEP IN MIND PART OF THE MAIN 
GOALS OF THE DAY TOGETHER IS TO 
SOLICIT INPUT ON OUR 
RECOMMENDATIONS.
AND MAKING SOME NOTES, THESE ARE
GREAT IDEAS.
HEATHER SNYDER ARE YOU STILL 
WITH US TO SPEAK TO THE QUESTION
PERTAINING TO FALLS AND 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH POST-TBI 
DEMENTIAS?
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK SO.
&gt;&gt; IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT
AREA 
OF RESEARCH.
A LOT OF STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED 
ASSOCIATIONS OF FALLS WITH 
DEMENTIA RISK AND MANY ASSUMED 
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY IS THE 
CONFOUNDER AND A COUPLE STUDIES 
FOUND THAT AND THE NOTION THAT A
FALL MAY BE A HARBINGER OR AN 
EARLY SIGN OF A 
NEURODEGENERATIVE PROCESS I 
THINK REQUIRES INVESTIGATION AND
SPANS BEYOND OUR SUBCOMMITTEE.
THERE'S A NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW
NUANCED THE TRAUMATIC BRAIN 
INJURY, IN LATE LIFE, FOR 
EXAMPLE, INTERACTS WITH OTHER 
NEURODEGENERATIVE PROCESSES AND 
MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM LATE LIFE
FALLS WHICH IS A CRITICAL TARGET
FOR PREVENTION.
&gt;&gt; FOR THE SECOND QUESTION
ABOUT
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE HIGHER 
INCIDENTS DUE TO CONFLICTS OR 
OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS.
AS PART OF THE ALZHEIMER'S 
RESEARCH PROGRAM WE'RE ALLOWED 
TO FUND INVESTIGATORS IN THOSE 
COUNTRIES AND COLLABORATING WITH
SOME OF THOSE AND WE ACTUALLY DO
HAVE SEVERAL STUDIES RIGHT NOW 
WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE 
FOLLOW-UP FROM POPULATIONS WHO 
HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF TRAUMATIC 
BRAIN INJURIES EVEN COMPARED TO 
THE UNITED STATES DUE TO 
MILITARY SERVICE AND G
GEOPOLITICAL COMPLEX AND CAN ADD
THAT TO THE KNOWLEDGE BASE GOING
FORWARD.
&gt;&gt; HOPEFULLY THE FOGARTY
CENTER 
WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST.
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT
CONCLUDES OUR 
TIME.
&gt;&gt; WE'LL SKIP THE
SCHEDULED 
BREAK AND KEEP GOING WITH THE 
LAST SESSION OF THE DAY IF THAT 
WORKS FOR EVERYBODY.
WE CAN TAKE A MINUTE WHILE OUR 
TEAM BRINGS UP THE SLIDES AND 
SESSION 4 SPEAKERS, PLEASE GET 
READY TO PRESENT.
THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR TUNING INTO OUR 
SESSION LATE AND I'M FROM 
BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL AND
LATE WAS NAMED IN 2019 DEFINED 
BY THE IMMIGRAAGGREGATION IN A  
ENTER SERVICE AND IT WAS FOUND 
IN THE FRONTAL GYRUS AND THE 
CLINICAL SYNDROME IS A COGNITIVE
DECLINE.
WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT LATE?
IT'S SENIOR AND PATHOLOGICAL 
SENSE SO IT'S AN IMPACTFUL 
PATHOLOGY THE THIRD TYPE OF 
DEMENTIA PRESENTATION AND 
FOLLOWS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND 
VASCULAR IMPAIRMENT TO ATTRIBUTE
TO THE RISK IN OLDER ADULTS.
ONE IN EVERY FIVE WITH TAU 
PATHOLOGY HAVE A PURE FORM OF 
LATE NC CAN BE FOUND IN OVER AGE
75 WITH SOLE PROGRESSION BUT 
PRETTY MUCH FROM CLINICAL 
PRACTICE STANDPOINT IT'S 
DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH FROM 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND YOU HAVE
TO RELY ON BIOMARKERS TO 
DISTINGUISH AND THE BIGGER 
IMPLICATIONS COME FROM THE MIX 
PATHOLOGY AND ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE AND LATE LIKES TO 
COMMINGLE.
MORE THAN HALF CASES WITH AD 
PATHOLOGY HAVE LATE NC AND THEY 
HAPPEN IN THE BACKGROUND OF 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND THIS 
COMBINED PATHOLOGY IS NOT ONLY 
THE MOST COMMON BUT THE MOST 
PROGRESSIVE AND SHOWS RAPID V
VOLUME LOSS AND HAS A GREAT 
PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT AND 
ESPECIALLY PROBATIC IN 
ANTI-AMYLOID ANTIBODIES BECAUSE 
IT CAN BE A MAJOR CONFOUNDER OF 
RESPONSE AND THE CLINICAL COURSE
IN THE SETTING OF COMBINED 
PATHOLOGY.
LAST BUT NOT LEAST, THE PUBLIC 
HEALTH IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH 
LATE IS ONLY EXPECTED TO 
INCREASE OVER TIME.
IT'S PREDOMINANTLY FOUND IN THE 
OLDEST OLD POPULATION AND THE 
RAPIDLY EXPANDING SEGMENT AND 
OVER 80 AND 90 THE IMPACT IS 
GREATER THAN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
ITSELF AS SHOWN BY THE 90 PLUS 
STUDY FROM THE UNITED STATES AND
THE STUDY FROM FINLAND.
GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANCE THE 
SUBCOMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED IN 
2019 AND MADE RECOMMENDATIONS IN
2022 AND GOALS WE SET WERE 
SUMMARIZED HONING THE DEFINITION
OF LATE AND HOW TO BETTER 
DIAGNOSIS THIS IN VIVO AND LOU 
TO STUDY MECHANISMS OF LATE 
PATHOGENESIS.
I'M GLAD TO REPORT THERE'S BEEN 
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE PAST
THREE YEARS.
WE NOW HAVE INITIAL CLINICAL 
CRITERIA TO USE IN THE CLINIC.
FOR EXAMPLE, THIS IS THE OUTLINE
OF THE CLINICAL KROO CRITERIA TO
DEFINE AS A PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS.
IF SOMEONE PRESENTS WITH 
COGNITIVE DECLINE WITH OTHER 
DOMAINS RELATIVELY PRESERVES AND
HIPPOCAMPAL ATROPHY AND 
BIOMARKERS THAT CASE IS 
DIAGNOSED AS PROBABLE LATE MEANS
LATE NEUROLOGICAL CHANGES ARE 
LIKELY THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE
CLASSIFICATION.
IF THEY HAVE A POSITIVE A BETA 
BIOMARKER WE CHECK TAU 
BIOMARKERS IN THE MEDIAL 
TEMPORAL LOBE AND IF IT'S 
NEGATIVE IT CAN BE DIAGNOSED AS 
POSSIBLE AND THERE'S MRI AND PET
PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
PATHOLOGICAL CHANGE.
HOWEVER, THERE'S STILL REMAINING
GAPS AND ONE BIG LIMITATION IS 
CLINICAL DATA SETS FOR OUR 
ABILITY TO PERFORM TARGET 
DISCOVERY EFFORTS.
WE HAVE A NEUROPATHOLOGY 
CRITERIA FOR LATE CHANGE AND 
DETAILS HOW TO DEFINE IT FOR 
EACH STAGE ALSO BETTER WAYS TO 
DISTINGUISH IT FROM OTHER TDP 
AGGREGATION DISORDERS AND ALS.
CLARIFYING THE RELATIONSHIP WITH
THE HIPPOCAMPUS IS CLOSELY 
RELATED HISTOLOGICAL FINDING 
NEEDS MORE WORK.
THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS IN 
MECHANISTIC STUDIES.
THE GENOME WIDE STUDY HAS BEEN 
PERFORMED AND CONFIRMED 
PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED GENETIC 
RISK FACTORS SUCH AS APOE 4 AND 
VARIANTS AS WELL AS GRANULIN 
VARIANT AND OTHER CANDIDATE 
MARKERS THAT CAN BE FOLLOWED UP 
IN THE FUTURE STUDIES.
AND SPLICING EVENTS COMPARED TO 
OTHER OPATHTIES AND THEY NEED 
MORE WORK.
BASED ON THE GAPS AND OTHERS, 
OUR SUBCOMMITTEE HAS A DRAFT FOR
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THESE WERE 
PRESENTED AND I'LL TOUCH ON 
RECOMMENDATION ONE BECAUSE TWO 
TO FOUR WILL BE COVERED BY MY 
COLLEAGUES FOLLOWING THIS 
PRESENTATION.
SO RECOMMENDATION ONE IS TO 
DEVELOP AND EXPAND THE PHENOTYPE
COHORTS WITH CHARACTERIZATION 
INCLUDING POSTMORTEM DATA WITH 
THE GOAL TO UNCOVER UNIQUE 
FEATURES OF LATE VERSUS OTHER 
PATHOLOGY TO INFORM DIAGNOSIS 
AND THERAPIES.
AND ALSO INFORM HOW TREATMENT 
AFFECTS LATE NC AND SO ON.
FINALLY, IT'S CRITICALLY 
IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT 
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CROSS-TALK 
BETWEEN THE FIELDS WITH ALS 
FIELDS THAT STUDY PATHOLOGIES 
AND ENHANCE THE FOR ALL THE 
DISORDERS.
AND EXPANDING AWARENESS IN THE 
PUBLIC CLINICIANS AND OTHER 
STAKEHOLDERS ARE IMPORTANT FOR 
THE COMMON UNDER STUDIED 
DISORDER.
THIS IS ALL I HAVE.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.
I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE NEXT 
SPEAKER, KONSTANTINOS.
&gt;&gt; I HAVE NOTHING TO
DISCLOSE.
THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS TO 
AND VALIDATE IN VIVO MODIFIERS 
AND RISK CLASSIFIER FOR LATENCY 
AND THEY MUST HAVE GOOD 
PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS IN 
PERSONS WITH LATE LIFE DEMENTIA 
SYNDROMES.
DIAGNOSIS IS ONLY VIABLE IN 
AUTOPSY AND IT'S A MAJOR STEP 
FORWARD IN TERMS OF LATE 
DETECTION.
HOWEVER, WITHOUT THE MARKER 
WE'RE LIMITED.
THEREFORE THERE'S AN URGENT NEED
FOR MOLECULARLY SPECIFIC 
MARKERS, CLASSIFIERS AND RISK 
PROIFIER FOR LATE TO ALLOW 
PARTICIPANT SELECTION OF LATE 
AND ABRB BECAUSE LATE IS OFTEN 
MIXED WITH OTHER 
NEUROPATHOLOGIES.
THEREFORE SUPPORT DRUG DISCOVERY
AND TREATMENT AND HAVING ACCESS 
TO ACCURATE MARKERS WILL ENHANCE
ALL OTHER RESEARCH ON LATE.
WE KNOW LATE IS RELATED TO 
MEMORY LOSS AND DEFICIT AND MORE
COMMON IN INDIVIDUALS OLDER THAN
75 YEARS OF AGE.
WE ALSO KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER 
OF GENES LINKED TO LATENCY.
HOWEVER WE NEED TO REFINE OUR 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE COGNITIVE, 
BEHAVIORAL AND GENETIC FEATURES 
ASSOCIATED WITH LATENCY.
BY DOING THAT WE MAY IMPROVE 
DETECTION OF LATE AND IF WE HAVE
A MARKER OF LATE, IT MAY HELP US
UNDERSTAND BETTER THE COGNITIVE 
BEHAVIOR AND GOOD MORNING 
FEATURES OF LATE.
SO, THIS IS A TWO-WAY STREET.
BY COMBINING IN VIVO OR EX VIVO 
MRI WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHOW 
LATENCY ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
TEMPORAL LOBES AND OTHER LOBES 
AND INSULA AND WE HAVE SHOWED 
LATENCY HAS A STRONGER IMPACT ON
THE HIPPOCAMPUS THAN 
ALZHEIMER'S.
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAP THE 
PATTERN OF OUR ABNORMALITIES 
ASSOCIATED WITH LATENCY AND TO 
DEMONSTRATE THE MAIN CONNECTIONS
IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE IMPLICATED
HERE ARE TEMPORAL CONNECTIONS, 
TEMPORAL BASAL GANGLION 
CONNECTIONS.
IN ADDITION, WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO 
SHOW THE PROGRESSION OF THE 
ABNORMALITIES IS FOLLOWING THE 
PROGRESSION OF LATENCY.
ALSO WE HAVE PATHOLOGY MAPPED 
PATTERN OF ABNORMALITIES IN THE 
BRAIN ASSOCIATED WITH LATENCY.
ADDITIONALLY, BY COMBINING EX 
VIVO MRI PATHOLOGY WE HAVE DEM 
VATE D -- DEMONSTRATED LATENCY 
FOLLOWS THE SPREAD CONSISTENT 
WITH THE SPREAD OF THE PATTERN.
OVER THE LAST FEW SLIDES I HOPE 
IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT MRI IS 
SENSITIVE TO THE BRAIN 
ABNORMALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH 
LATE NC AND FUTURE STUDIES COULD
USE THESE AND OTHER FEATURES TO 
TRAIN MRI BASED CLASSIFIERS OF 
LATENCY.
USING PET STUDIES HAVE SHOWN 
LATENCY IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE 
PRONOUNCED HYPERMETABOLISM IN 
THE MEDIAL TEMPORAL LOBE AND THE
PATTERN IS TRUE FOR ALZHEIMER'S.
THEREFORE THE STUDY HAS 
SUGGESTED
SUGGESTED IT MAY BE A MARKER FOR
LATENCY.
FURTHER WORK IS NEEDED TO TEST 
THE CLASSIFIERS OF LATENCY.
AND THERE'S FEATURES AND 
ADDITIONAL FEATURES AND FOR NOW 
WE NEED TO TEST THE CLINICAL 
CRITERIA USING LONGITUDINAL 
OBSERVATIONS AND NEUROIMAGING 
MARKERS AND NEUROPATHOLOGY.
IN THE FUTURE WE NEED TO UPDATE 
THE CRITERIA BASED ON 
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD.
AND HIGHER LEVELS OF TDP43 IN 
THE PLASMA DERIVED EXTRA 
CELLULAR VESICLES WITH THOSE 
WITH TDP AND IN ADDITION LOSS OF
TDP43 AND PROTEINOPATHY IS 
LINKED TO THE EXPRESSION OF THE 
AND RECENT STUDIES SUGGESTED THE
PLASMA OR CSF HAS POTENTIAL AS A
MARKER FOR LATE.
ADDITIONAL WORK IS NEEDED TO 
DEVELOP AND TEST BIOFLUID 
MARKERS OF LATENCY.
ALSO EXCITING FINDINGS COME FROM
THE FIELD OF PET MARKERS OF 
TDP43 WHERE RELATIVELY RECENTLY 
NEW PET LIGAND HAS SHOWN 
PERFORMS  PERFORMANCE IN THE 
SAMPLES AND IN ANIMAL TESTS.
AS FAR AS I KNOW THIS IS 
CURRENTLY BEING TESTED IN HUME 
CANS HAVE AND ADDITIONAL WORK IS
NEEDED TO TEST LATENCY.
IN CONCLUSION THERE'S AN URGENT 
NEED FOR MARKERS OR CLASSIFIERS 
THAT SHOW GOOD DISCRIMINATION OF
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND COULD BE 
NEUROIMAGING OR BIO FLUID OR IN 
COMBINATION.
IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THE ABOVE
AWAY NEED COHORTS TO JOIN 
MARKERS WITH DATA AND PATHOLOGY 
AND EX VIVO MRI.
IN ADDITION WE NEED TO REFINE 
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
COGNITIVE AND GENETIC FEATURES 
ASSOCIATED WITH LATENCY AND WE 
ALSO NEED TO TEST THE CLINICAL 
CRITERIA AND UPDATE THIS 
CRITERIA IN THE FUTURE DEPENDING
ON NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE 
FIELD.
THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.
I'LL CONTINUE LOOKING AT THE 
CAUSES AND THERAPEUTIC 
OPPORTUNITIES.
AND LOOK AT CAUSES AND THROUGH 
HUMAN STUDIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
MODELS AND AGING AND 
PATHOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR AND 
STRUCTURAL PATHOLOGIES WITH THE 
FOCUS ON DEVELOPING AND TESTING 
TARGETS FOR THERAPEUTICS.
THE FIRST ASPECT IS DESIGN AND 
DEVELOP MODELS OF LATE NC.
IN MANY SLIDES I'M USING 
EXAMPLES FROM OTHER ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE RELATES DEMENTIAS 
BECAUSE IT'S THE MODELS LACKING 
IN LATE NC SPECIFIC MODELS.
SO HUMANS SEEM TO HAVE THIS 
UNIQUE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO LATE NC
HOWEVER, WE DON'T HAVE GOOD 
MODELS OF LATE NC IN MISSING OR 
OTHER ANIMAL MODELS.
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS 
DEVELOP MODELS OF DYSFUNCTION 
NOT JUST IN ALS THAT ALREADY 
EXIST BUT WHERE WITH HAVE 
PHENOTYPES IN THE MODELS.
ADDITIONALLY IN THE MODELS WED 
LIKE TO CHARACTERIZE GLIAL AND 
NEURAL INFLAMMATORY 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO TDP ADENOPATHY 
AND THERE'S MOLE  MODELS OF THIS
IN ALS AND WOULD LIKE TO 
TRANSLATE THE  MODELS IN LATE.
WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO LOOK AT 
DEVELOPING CELLULAR NOLDES AND 
HOW TO MODEL LATE NC PATHOLOGY 
IN INDUCED PLURIMOW  -- 
PLURIPOTENT MODELS AND IN THE 
CULTURE SYSTEM OR USED PATIENT 
DERIVED HAVE LATE WILL THOSE 
REPRESENT ANY PHENOTYPES SEEN IN
LATE AS SUGGESTED BY SOME FOR 
ALS.
AND OBSERVE WHAT'S BEEN IN 
PATIENT GLIAL CELLS AND THIS IS 
IMPORTANT TO DEFINE THE LOSS OF 
FUNCTION AND GAIN OF CYTOPLASMIC
CYTOPLASMIC FUNCTION AND WHAT 
CAN WE DO TO MODEL LATE NC IN 
CELLS TO STUDY THIS CONDITION IN
DETAIL.
AND TO GO FURTHER TOWARDS 
STRUCTURALLY SPECIFIC AND IN 
VITRO MODELS WHERE WE NEED TO 
UNDERSTAND LATE SPECIFIC ULTRA 
STRUCTURE OF TDP43 ITSELF WHEN 
IT'S DEPOSITED AND POTENTIAL 
CO-DEPOSITED PROTEINS IN 
ORGANISM MODELS AND BIO CHEMICAL
MODELS AND WOULD LIKE TO 
UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE OF 
TDP43 AND HAS BEEN DISCOVERED BY
WORK IN A LAB IN THE U.K. AND 
WHAT IS THE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE 
IN LATE?
THAT BRINGS UP AN IMPORTANT 
QUESTION.
ANOTHER ASPECT OF OUR 
RECOMMENDATION IS TO LOOK AT THE
TDP43 STRUCTURE DIRECTLY AND TRY
TO UNDERSTAND THE PRIMARY 
STRUCTURAL AND POST 
TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS AND 
THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPOSITION OF
CO-DEPOSITED PROTEINS.
FOR EXAMPLE IN FTLD IS THAT THE 
CASE IN THE LATE AND WE DO SEE 
OTHER PROTEINS CODEPOSITED IN 
LATE.
IMPORTANTLY WE'D LIKE TO 
UNDERSTAND HOW THE PATHOLOGICAL 
INCLUSION FORMED.
WHAT IS THE ASSEMBLIES FORMED 
AND CAN WE PREVENT THE FORMATION
OF THESE ABHORRENT STRUCTURES 
AND WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE 
INITIALLY BEFORE DEPOSITION AND 
EITHER OF THESE THINGS, THESE 
TOXIC OR POTENTIALLY TOXIC 
INCLUSIONS THAT ARE STRUCTURES 
ON THE LEFT OR THESE FUNCTIONAL 
ASSEMBLIES OF THE SAME REGION OF
TDP43 IN THE CENTER MAY BE 
TARGETS FOR THERAPEUTIC 
MODULATION.
THERE'S CO-DEPOSITED PROTEINS 
AND WHAT ARE THESE MOLECULAR 
CONSEQUENCE OF THE PATHOLOGIES?
WE ALSO NEED TO DESIGN MODELS 
THAT INCORPORATE NOT JUST TDP43 
PATHOLOGY BUT CO-PATHOLOGIES AND
IF THERE'S SYNUCLEIN PATHOLOGIES
AND ORGANISM MODELS AND IF IT 
COEXISTS WITH OTHER PATHOLOGIES 
WE FEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY 
ARE INTERACT.
WE NEED TO STUDY THE MECHANISTIC
BASIS OF DISEASE INITIATION.
HOW DO THE DISEASE START AND HOW
ARE NEURONS LOST?
HOW ARE BRAIN REGIONS TARGETED 
FOR DEGENERATION SPECIFIED IN 
LATE AGE RELATED PROGRESSION IS 
PRIMARILY IMPORTANT.
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT 
WORKS.
CAN WE DEVELOP MODELS THAT 
INCORPORATE AGE-RELATED 
PROGRESSION AND HOW IS 
PROGRESSION ACROSS THE BRAIN 
AREAS INCLUDED.
WE ALSO NEED TO DISCOVER GENETIC
CAUSATIVE FACTORS FOR LATE.
SO SEVERAL HAVE BEEN SHOWN AS OR
DISCOVERED AS SHOWN HERE.
WILL WE BE ABLE TO CONFIRM THESE
BY REPLICATION AND WILL WE FIND 
NEW GENES CAUSATIVE FOR LATE AND
OTHER TDP43 PROTEINOPATHIES BE 
CAUSATIVE FOR LATE.
WE NEED TO STUDY THE LATE 
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY.
WHAT ARE THE SPLICING CHANGES WE
HEARD ABOUT.
THERE WAS A RECENT STUDY SHOWN 
JUST LAST WEEK THAT THE AMYLOID 
PRECURSOR PROTEIN IS PROCESSED 
IN THE CYTOPLASMIC GAIN OF 
FUNCTION AND IT WOULD BE 
INTERESTING TO STUDY WHAT ARE 
THE CORRECTIBLE CHANGES THAT 
COULD BE TARGETED.
&gt;&gt; WE'RE AT TIME.
&gt;&gt; WE NEED TO GEAR UP TO
STUDY 
THESE IN MODELS.
WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION ON THESE 
POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC 
TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE WE KNOW IN'
SENSE ALOGOES CAN BE SUCCESSFUL 
TREATMENT AND WE'VE HAD 
THERAPEUTICS IN SPINAL ATROPHY 
AND WE NEED MODELS TO TEST THESE
THERAPIES IN TDP43.
I'LL LEAVE IT THERE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
&gt;&gt; WE'LL GO STRAIGHT TO 
DR. NELSON'S TALK.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU TO THE
ORGANIZERS.
I APPRECIATE IT.
IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE PART OF 
THIS EXCELLENT SUMMIT.
I HAVE NOTHING TO DISCLOSE.
I'M TALKING TODAY ABOUT 
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO 
HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS OF AGING 
AND I CAN SAY BASICALLY IT 
BREAKS DOWN TO TWO THINGS.
NUMBER ONE, IMPROVING OUR 
CLASSIFICATION AND DIAGNOSIS AND
TWO, IMPROVING OUR UNDERSTANDING
OF THE MECHANISM TO PROVIDE 
TARGETS FOR FUTURE THERAPIES.
SO WHAT IS HIPPOCAMPUS SCLEROSIS
IT'S LOSS IN THE MEDIAL TEMPORAL
GLOBE AND THE NORMAL HIPPOCAMPUS
ON THE RIGHT.
YOU SEE THE SHRIVALLED 
HIPPOCAMPUS WITH CELL LOSS AND 
GLIOSIS.
THIS IS A COMMON PATHOLOGY.
10% LIFE TIME RISK AND AFFECTED 
25% OF PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA.
IT DOESN'T AFFECT PEOPLE EQUALLY
ALONG THE HUMAN AGING SPECTRUM.
HERE YOU SEE THE NEXT SLIDE.
GO BACK TO THE LAST SLIDE.
THIS SHOWS YOU ON THE X AXIS IS 
AGE AND THE Y AXIS IS PATHOLOGY.
THE BLACK TRACE SMOOTHED BY 
MEASURES IS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 
AND HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS 
PATHOLOGY IS THE RED TRACE AND 
UNLIKE ALZHEIMER'S HIPPOCAMPAL 
SCLEROSIS THAT FOCUSES MOSTLY ON
THE OLDEST OLD.
HOWEVER IT'S A SOMEWHAT 
CONFUSING TEAM AND OFTEN LINKED 
TO EPILEPSY.
TO DESCRIBE THIS WE DID A SURVEY
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY 
WHICH IS A UNIVERSITY THAT HAS A
VERY GOOD FAMILIARITY WITH THE 
CONDITION.
WE DID THE SURVEY TWICE.
IN 2018 AND 2015 TO SEE WHAT WAS
THE EFFECT OF THE NEW 
NOMENCLATURE AND THIS WAS PART 
OF THE PART  -- PART PASSION -- 
PARTICIPATION AND 80% OF THE 
RESPONDENTS SAID IT WAS AN 
EPILEPSY DISORDER TERM AND WE 
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER IN 
2025.
BUT REGRETTABLY IT'S NOT THE 
CASE.
IT'S STILL NOT REALLY THE TERM 
THAT PEOPLE THINK OF WHEN THEY 
THINK OF HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS 
THEY THINK OF A DIFFERENT 
PATHOMECHANISM OF HIPPOCAMPUS 
SCLEROSIS DIFFERENT FROM THAT 
WHICH AFFECTS DEMENTIA AND IT'S 
MORE COMMON.
SO WE CONCLUDE THAT WE NEED MORE
TERMINOLOGY FOR HIPPOCAMPAL 
SCLEROSIS OF AGING.
THE GOLD STANDARD DEFINITION 
WHICH IS A PATHOLOGY NEEDS TO BE
STANDARDIZED AND OPTIMIZED IN A 
DATA-DRIVEN WAY.
SO IT'S STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH
LATE NC BUT NOT SYNONYMOUS.
ON THE RIGHT YOU SEE THE VEN 
DIAGRAM THAT SHOWS A MEANINGFUL 
CONCEPTUALIZATION OF HIPPOCAMPAL
SCLEROSIS OF AGING IS THE MORE 
SEVERE SUB TYPE OF LATE NC AND 
THAT COULD BE CONNECTED TO THE 
PATHOGENIC PROGRESSION THAT'S 
HYPOTHESIZED FROM NO LATE TO 
LATE WITH NO PATHOLOGY AND THE 
ORANGE ARROW GOES TO LATE WITH 
HS MAYBE THE QUESTION IS YOU SEE
THE STRONG HIPPOCAMPUS AND IT'S 
LOGICAL YOU THINK IT WOULD BE 
BAD FOR YOU BUT WE AND OTHERS 
AROUND THE WORLD FOUND THIS 
PROGRESSION FROM LATE TO LATE 
NC-HS IS ASSOCIATED WITH WORSE 
PROGRESSION BUT NOT SEIZURES OR 
AD PATHOLOGY BUT LATE NC STAGES.
SO THE WAY YOU DETECT IT IN THE 
CLINIC IS BY MRI AT THIS POINT.
THIS IS MY PICTURE OF AN 
INDIVIDUAL WHO PASSED AT THE AGE
OF 93 AND HAS THESE NICE 
POSTMORTEM IMAGES TAKEN BUT THAT
IS TO UNDER SCORE SOME THINGS 
THAT WAS SAID THE HIPPOCAMPAL 
ATROPHY AND SCLEROSIS IS WORSE 
THAN WHAT YOU SEE WITH 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.
WE NEED SPECIFIC CUT POINTS AND 
UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISM FOR HOW
THIS DEGENERATION OCCURS.
AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT LATE NC.
SO WHY DO SOME SUBSET OF PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE LATE AND NOT OTHERS 
DEVELOP HS AND THESE MECHANISTIC
INSIGHTS CAN BE TRANSLATABLE.
SO LABS AROUND THE WORLD THAT 
FOUND EVIDENCE OF POSSIBLE 
PATHOGENETIC MECHANISMS 
VASCULAROPATHY AND MORE 
INFLAMMATION AND WE NEED MORE 
SYSTEMS TO GENERATE TRANSLATABLE
MECHANISMS.
THESE MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS GIVES
US STRATEGIES.
I WANT TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A 
SPECIFIC CLINICAL RESEARCH ARM 
THAT HAS LED DIRECTLY TO A 
CLINICAL TRIAL AIMED AT 
PREVENTING DEMENTIA IN OLD 
PEOPLE AND HAS NOTHING TO DO 
WITH ALZHEIMER'S AND DAVID FARDO
GENERATED THIS AND THERE WAS A 
DRUG THAT A COLLEAGUE OF MINE AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY ARE 
USING IN THE FIRST CLINICAL 
TRIAL FOR LATE HS.
AND TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OVER ALL
IDEA OF WHAT IS GOING ON THERE, 
IT'S THERE'S A NEW STANDARD OF A
PATIENT WHO'S COGNITION IS 
SLIPPING AND THERE'S A BIOMARKER
MANIFESTING.
AND IF THERE'S ABETA AMYLOIDOSIS
NOTICED BY BIOMARKER EVIDENCE 
THERE'S HOPE.
IT'S NOT 100% PERFECT BUT NO -- 
&gt;&gt; DR. NELSON, TIME IS UP.
&gt;&gt; I'M ALMOST DONE.
AND COHORTS COGNITIVE IMPAIRED 
AND SOME HAVE THIS TYPE OF 
AMYLOIDOSIS AND IF YOU HAVE THE 
IMPAIRMENT AND IF YOU HAVE THIS 
MRI PICTURE THEN HOPEFULLY WE 
CAN DEVELOP NEW REMEDIES AND A 
CLINICAL TRIAL SUBJECT TO 
PERHAPS PREVENT FURTHER 
DEGENERATION.
AND THANK YOU AND I'VE GOT IT.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH.
&gt;&gt; SO WE'LL HAVE 15
MINUTES FOR 
QUESTIONS.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU TO THE
COMMITTEE 
AND THE WHOLE GROUP AND 
OBVIOUSLY NINDS FOR SUPPORTING 
THIS.
I'M CHAIRING THE SESSION.
I GUESS I DID WANT TO START FROM
ONE COMMENT FROM WITHIN OUR 
PANEL AN INDIVIDUAL, DEIDRE AND 
HER LIVED EXPERIENCE AND GIVE 
HER AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW 
WORDS.
&gt;&gt; YES, MY PAST YEAR MY
MOTHER 
WAS DIAGNOSED LATE.
OUR JOURNEY TO LATE BEGAN WITH 
THE DIAGNOSIS IN 2018 OF MILD 
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT DUE TO 
ALZHEIMER'S.
SHE WAS 81.
WE WERE BRACING FOR THE 
PROGRESSION TO DEMENTIA AND 
AFTER THE DIAGNOSIS OF MILD 
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SHE 
REMAINED AT THAT LEVEL WITHOUT 
FURTHER DEFICIT WHICH WAS 
SURPRISING AND THEN WE WERE TOLD
SHE HAD LATE OR TDP43.
WE LEARNED IT WAS SLOWER MOVING 
THAN ALZHEIMER'S AND WOULD 
AFFECT HER ABILITY TO LEARN NEW 
THINGS AND HAD A PET SCAN TO 
CONFIRM NO AMYLOID PLAQUE AND 
WERE TOLD HER CEREBRAL CORTEX 
WAS INTACT.
IT'S THE FIRST TIME AS A FAMILY 
WE FELT HOPE BECAUSE A DIFFICULT
PART FOR ME WAS TALKING TO MY 
MOM AND EACH TIME WONDERING WILL
THIS BE THE LAST TIME SHE KNOWS 
WHO I AM AND NOW WITH THE NEW 
DIAGNOSIS IT'S EDUCATING ALL 
THOSE WHO ASSIST HER TO THIS 
CONDITION AND WE HAD A FAMILY 
WITH HER 24/7 SO SHE WOULDN'T 
GET LOST IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND 
HAD TO EDUCATE ALL THE DOCTORS 
AND NURSES ON THE DIAGNOSIS AND 
WEREN'T AWARE OF LATE AND WERE 
THANKFUL AND IT DOES MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE IN THE CARE AND I 
CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH TO GET THE 
INFORMATION OUT TO FAMILIES TO 
NAVIGATE LATE AND ASSIST HEALTH 
CARE PROVIDERS AND THEIR 
APPROACH TO THE PATIENTS AND I 
KNOW THERE'S RECENT CRITERIA 
ABOUT TO BE PUBLISHED WHICH IS 
WONDERFUL AND HOPEFULLY THERE'LL
BE CARE GUIDELINES TAILORED TO 
LATE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW AS A 
FAMILY WE IS HAVE TO EDUCATE 
THOSE AROUND US HOW BEST TO 
SUPPORT MY MOTHER AND AT THE END
IT REALLY WAS A GAME CHANGER TO 
FIND OUT HER ACTUAL DIAGNOSIS 
AND IT'S HEARTENING TO KNOW 
THERE'S TEAMS LIKE AT PENN 
MEDICINE TO CARE ENOUGH TO 
PROVIDE ANSWERS TO THOSE WHO 
DON'T EXHIBIT THE TYPICAL 
MANIFESTATIONS OF ALZHEIMER'S 
AND GIVES PEOPLE A SENSE OF 
WHAT'S GOING ON.
AGAIN, GETTING THE WORD OUT IS 
EVERYTHING AND THANK YOU SO MUCH
AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME SOME
TIME TO SPEAK.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, DEIDRE, IN
THE 
ADDITION OF DIAGNOSIS THERE'S 
DEMYSTIFYING THE CONDITION AND 
THE ABILITY TO DESCRIBE LATE IS 
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.
&gt;&gt; I HAVE MANY QUESTIONS
BUT IN 
THE INTEREST OF TIME I HAVE ONE 
FOR THE HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS 
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM AND 
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS DIAGNOSIS 
THERE'S A LOT OF INCONSISTENCY 
LEADING TO AGREEMENT BETWEEN 
DIFFERENT GROUPS.
I DON'T SEE A LOT OF EFFORT IN 
TRYING TO UNIFY THE DIAGNOSIS OR
SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP 
US TALK THE SAME LANGUAGE WHEN 
WE SAY HIPPOCAMPUS SCLEROSIS OF 
AGING AND THE OTHER DOWN THE 
LINE IS MOVING AWAY FROM A 
BINARY DIAGNOSIS AND COMING UP 
WITH AT LEAST AN ORGANAL 
CRITERIA LIKE WITH OTHER 
PATHOLOGIES.
&gt;&gt; YOUR POINT IS WELL
TAKEN.
WE NEED BETTER CRITERIA FOR HOW 
WE THRESHOLD OUR DIAGNOSES IN 
THE PATHOLOGICAL AND STRUCTURAL 
IMAGING CONTEXT.
WE NEED THAT AND ONE OF THE 
STRONG RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE 
MADE IS THAT BOTH FOR IS THE 
BIOMARKER OF OPATHY WE NEED 
GROUPS TO COME TOGETHER AND MAKE
THE CALLS.
&gt;&gt; AND COME UP WITH
HARMONIZED 
PROTOCOLS WITH HOW PATHOLOGISTS 
SPEAK ABOUT HIPPOCAMPAL 
SCLEROSIS AND MOVE IT TO CLINIC.
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO RAISE UP WHEN
IT 
COMES TO ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE-RELATED DIMENTIAS ARE 
DIFFERENT THAN LATE NC EVEN TO 
THIS DAY PEOPLE WILL THINK 
THEY'RE BEING IMPACTED BY 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND IN YEARS
PAST BEFORE ALL THE WORK YOU 
GUYS HAVE DONE SO NEATLY HAS 
SHOWN MORE WHAT THE DISEASE IS.
AND TO THAT END, TDP43 HAS BEEN 
ON THE BACK FOOT AND HOW CAN WE 
OVERCOME THE INJUSTICE OF THAT 
VERY IMPORTANT THING AND 
FAMILIES EVEN SAYING IT'S 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND TALKING 
TO PEOPLE BUILT AND NOT KNOWING 
IT'S AMYLOID AND TAU IMPLICATED 
AND THAT'S A BIG PICTURE 
QUESTION AND THERE'S WORK 
SHOWING TDP43 IS SHOWN 
DYSFUNCTIONALLY IN OTHER BODY 
PARTS AND THE GUT WHICH COULD BE
A WAY THAT IT'S TRANSMITTED I 
GATHER.
SO, ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT OR 
ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT IT?
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
&gt;&gt; I'LL TAKE THE FIRST
PART OF 
OF THAT QUESTION AND TURN TO 
OTHERS IF YOU WANT TO TALK MORE 
ABOUT OUTSIDE THE BRAIN.
I THINK WE NOW KNOW ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE HAS MULTIPLE PATHOLOGIES
AND THERE'S THE IMPORTANCE OF 
UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF TDP 
AND LATE WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND ABLE TO 
IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUALS WITH 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE WHO HAVE THE
CO-PATHOLOGY BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST
CERTAIN THERE'S MECHANISTIC 
DIFFERENCES THAT CAUSE ONE 
INDIVIDUAL TO HAVE CON COMBINANT
TDB AND WHEN WE'RE ENGAGED WITH 
THERAPEUTICS FOR ALZHEIMER'S 
DISEASE WE'RE GOING TO BE 
NEEDING TO FIGURE OUT WHO HAVE 
THE CO-PATHOLOGIES AND HOW IT 
AFFECTS OUTCOMES AND OF WHAT 
OTHERS STRESSED AND WE NEED GOOD
BIOMARKERS TO TELL US MORE 
DEFINITIVELY ABOUT THE PRESENCE 
OF DETERMINING AND HAVING BETTER
BIOMARKERS IS IMPORTANT AND YOU 
MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF 
EDUCATING THE COMMUNITY ABOUT 
THAT AND A -- THERE'S STATEMENTS
OF MORE COMMUNITY OUTREACH IN 
UNDERSTANDING THE CONDITION 
WHICH IS KEY BECAUSE MANY 
NEUROLOGISTS LET ALONE PRIMARY 
CARE DOCTORS HAVE NEVER HEARD OF
THE DIAGNOSTIC ENTITY.
I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE WANTS TO 
COMMENT OUT SIDE THE BRAIN IN 
TERMS OF TDP43 FUNCTION AT ALL.
NO TAKERS?
ONE THING WE STRESSED IN THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO 
COLLABORATE AND WORK WELL WITH 
THE BROADER TDP43 COMMUNITY AND 
ALS AND IF FTD WAS THERE'S LOTS 
OF WISDOM FROM MANY YEARS OF 
WORK THIS FIELD CAN GAIN FROM 
AND CERTAINLY I THINK 
COLLABORATION IS CRITICAL.
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ON
THE 
VIDEOCAST.
THEY'RE ABOUT DETECTING TDP43 IN
LATE AND IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY
TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM 
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.
WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON TREATMENTS
AND CLINICAL BIOMARKERS AND THE 
OTHER IS A MORE TECHNICAL 
QUESTION ABOUT WHAT IS NEEDED TO
DETECT TDP43 DEPOSITS.
DO WE NEED DEVELOPMENT OF 
NON-AMINO HISTOCHEMISTRY METHODS
TO BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO DETECT OR 
IS IT DIFFERENT SPECIES OF TDP43
BOTH ON THE TECHNICAL DETECTION 
AND THE IMPACT.
&gt;&gt; THOSE ARE GREAT
QUESTIONS.
I DON'T KNOW, KONSTATINOS DID 
YOU WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS?
&gt;&gt; WE KNOW LATE NC IS
MIXED WITH
OTHER PATHOLOGIES COMMONLY.
THIS MEANS IF WE HAVE A MARKER 
FOR LATE NC WE'RE NOT GOING TO 
BE ONLY HELPING CLINICAL TRIALS 
IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF LATE BUT 
ALSO GOING TO BE HELPING 
CLINICAL TRIALS IN TREATMENT FOR
OTHER PATHOLOGIES FOR THE SIMPLE
REASON IF YOU HAVE THE 
SUCCESSFUL ALZHEIMER'S DRUG BUT 
TESTING ON PEOPLE THAT HAVE 
LATE, THESE PEOPLE MAY PROGRESS 
AND HAVE DEMENTIA AT SOME POINT.
IT DOESN'T MEAN THE ALZHEIMER'S 
DRUG DID NOT WORK.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE 
TO IDENTIFY NOT ONLY FOR 
DIAGNOSING AND TREATING BUT 
ATTACKING ADRD.
THEN THE SECOND QUESTION WAS YOU
SAID -- 
&gt;&gt; MORE AROUND THE
QUESTION 
ABOUT DETECTION OF -- TECHNICAL 
BARRIERS.
&gt;&gt; AT THIS POINT I THINK
IT'S 
WISE WE DO IT THIS WAY AND 
ATTACK IT FROM ALL ASPECTS.
THERE BLOOD BASED MARKERS AND 
TRACERS TO DETECT THE PATHOLOGY 
AND SPECIFIC MARKERS AND EVERY 
ASPECT.
I THINK THERE ARE VERY HOPEFUL 
SIGNS FROM EACH ONE OF THEM EVEN
THE CLINICAL CRITERIA ALREADY 
INCLUDES INFORMATION WITH KNEW 
KNOWLEDGE GENERATED FROM THE 
BIOMARKER POINT OF VIEW.
I FEEL THE CLINICAL CRITERIA 
WILL ABSORB THE INFORMATION AND 
INCORPORATE THEM.
I THINK WE'RE SEEING VERSION ONE
OF THE CLINICAL CRITERIA RIGHT 
NOW WHICH IS A HUGE STEP FORWARD
BUT WE NEED TO GO TO VERSION 
TWO.
&gt;&gt; A QUICK POINT.
THE POINTS MADE BY THE PATIENT'S
DAUGHTER WERE IMPORTANT TO ME 
AND THIS PERVADES TO EVERYTHING 
WE HEARD TODAY AND NOT JUST WITH
LATE OR AD BUT THE DEMENTIA 
FIELD NEEDS TO LEARN FROM THE 
CANCER FIELD SOME OF THE 
CULTURAL ADVANCES THEY HAVE 
ACHIEVED THAT HAVE BEEN 
TRANSLATED TO SCIENTIFIC 
ADVANCES AND NOT BE AFRAID OF 
COMPLEXITY.
CANCER GRAPPLES WITH DEEP 
COMPLEXITY AND HAS COME UP WITH 
IT ON THE UPPER HAND IN MANY 
WAYS.
WE HAVE BEEN VERY AVERSE TO IT 
AND WE TEND TO DICHOTOMIZE 
THINGS AS YES, NO, YES, NO.
IT'S NOT A YES, NO SITUATION.
THERE'S FACTORS AND GENETIC AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL.
THE COMPLEXITY, NUMBER ONE, 
NUMBER TWO, WE NEED TO GET TO 
THEIR ASSESSMENTS.
THE BIOMARKERS WORK AND THERE 
USED TO BE A CULTURE WHERE THERE
IS IN CANCER AND NOT CURRENTLY 
IN DEMENTIA TREATMENT AND CARE.
AND WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE TO 
KNOW WHAT TO SCREEN THEM FOR AND
WHAT THEY'RE AT RISK FOR AND TO 
THEN GIVE THEM OPTIONS.
IT'S NOT TELLING THEM THEY HAVE 
TO DO THIS OR THAT BUT PEOPLE 
ARE SCARED OF DEMENTIA AS MUCH 
AS THEY'RE SCARED AS CANCER AND 
WE'VE ACTED AS THOUGH BEING 
INTERVENTIONISTS ARE BAD AND 
IT'S NOT IT'S GIVING PEOPLE 
CHOICES AND DECISIONS ON THEIR 
OWN AND THOSE ELEMENTS OF CANCER
CULTURE WE CAN LEARN A LOT FROM.
&gt;&gt; AND THERE'S A MORE
PRECISION 
MEDICINE APPROACH AND IN THE 
CONTEXT OF ALZHEIMER'S BUT IN 
THE CONTEXT OF OTHER 
NEURODEGENERATIVE CONDITIONS IN 
ITS OWN RIGHT.
DEVELOPING BIOMARKERS WILL HAVE 
THAT IMPACT.
&gt;&gt; IF I CAN ADD TO THE
ANSWER.
SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE 
TDP43 PATHOLOGY DETECTION WITHIN
THE LDP SPACE THERE'S MULTIPLE 
PATHOLOGY.
WITHIN THE ALS SPACE AND FTD 
SPACE AND LATE SPACE, THERE'S A 
SENSE WHERE THE DIRECTION OF 
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY HAS BEEN 
DIFFICULT AND HARDER TO DETECT 
COMPARED TO OTHER FORMS OF 
PATHOLOGY BUT THE ABSENCE OF 
TDP43 ACTION THROUGH THE KRY
KRYPTONS MAY BE EASIER TO DETECT
AND AS DR. NELSON SAID EXTREMELY
WELL, WE ALSO NEED TO THINK OF 
OPPORTUNITIES TO COME UP WITH 
TOOLS THAT WILL NOT END UP 
HAVING BANKRUPT OUR SOCIETY TO 
BE BLUNT AND BE AT THE 
INTERSECTION AND NOT LOOKING FOR
EACH INDIVIDUAL FORM OF 
PHOSPHORYLATED TDP43 BUT LOSS OF
FUNCTION THAT COULD BE 
APPLICABLE ACROSS BECAUSE IT 
WILL BE A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE FOR
OUR SOCIETY.
&gt;&gt; THOSE ARE ALL EXCELLENT
POINTS.
I THINK TRYING TO SEE WHERE OUR 
BIOMARKERS OVERLAP VERSUS WHERE 
THEY'RE DISTINCTIVE.
PET TRACERS MAY DIFFERENTIALLY 
BIND TO AGGREGATE FORMS OF TDP43
AND THE CONTEXT OF LATE VERSUS 
OTHER CONDITIONS.
I SEE ANOTHER HAND UP.
I THINK IT'S MITCH.
&gt;&gt; HI.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I WANTED TO AMPLIFY SOME RECENT 
COMMENTS ABOUT COMPLEXITY AND 
BUT IN STUDIES WITH TESTING OF 
COGNITION IN TERMS OF THAT TYPE 
OF BIOMARKER TO LOOK AT WEATHER 
THERE IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF 
CO-OCCURRING AD PATHOLOGY WITH 
MULTI-DOMAIN TESTING AND SEE 
WHAT HAPPENS FIRST AND LATER ON.
A CORRELATION TO THAT IS 
ASSOCIATION OF COGNITION IMPROVE
THE PRECISION OF THAT TYPE OF 
COGNITIVE BIOMARKER GOING 
FORWARD.
&gt;&gt; I'LL JUST -- THOSE ARE
GREAT 
QUESTIONS, MITCH.
THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF 
ANTI-MORTEM, POSTMORTEM STUDIES 
LOOKING AT COGNITION OVER TIME.
THERE'S BEEN A RUSH GROUP THAT'S
DONE BEAUTIFUL WORK LOOKING AT 
COGNITIVE CHANGES AND THE 
SEQUENCES OVER TIME BUT I ARGUE 
DEFINING PEOPLE IN VIVO IS 
CRITICAL TO GET MORE NUANCED 
UNDERSTANDING OF COGNITION IS 
YOUR NOT RELIANT ON PREVIOUSLY 
COLLECTED STANDARDIZED DATA AND 
IMPLEMENT DIGITAL BIOMARKERS.
THAT'S WHY THE FIRST 
RECOMMENDATION REALLY STRESSES 
THE IMPORTANCE OF DEEPLY 
PHENOTYPED COHORTS WHERE WE'RE 
FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALS AND 
CLASSIFYING THEM LONGITUDINALLY 
HOPEFULLY TO AUTOPSY AND LINK 
WHAT WE SEE PATH LOGICALLY TO 
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN VIVO.
&gt;&gt; I AGREE.
THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; GO AHEAD WITH YOUR
QUESTION.
 
OKAY.
SO WE'LL ALSO HAVE TIME AGAIN AT
THE END OF DAY TWO TO TAKE 
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND 
COMMENTS FROM ANY OF THE 
SESSIONS FROM THE TWO DAYS.
&gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE COULDN'T BE
HERE.
I WANT TO SAY THANKS FOR JULIE 
SNYDER A LEADER HERE AND 
DRDR
DR. GIFFIN AND HAS BEEN A TREAT 
TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, PETE.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU SO MUCH.
AND GREAT JOB.
SORRY FOR RUNNING A LITTLE BIT 
OVER BUT WE HAVE AFTER MEETING 
SLIDES THAT WILL COME UP AND 
WE'LL ADJOURN FOR THE DAY.
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU ALL.
