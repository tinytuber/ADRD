-Good morning, and welcome
to Day 2
of the ADRD Summit 2022.
We're really excited for
the continued presentations
and feedback on draft
research recommendations.
And to start the day off,
it's my honor and privilege
to introduce a video
highlighting experience
of people living with dementia
and those caring for them.
This video was developed
by the NINDS
Office of Neuroscience,
Communications, and Engagement.
♪♪
♪♪
-I'm Jim Taylor,
and this is my wife Jerry.
And Jerry was diagnosed
first with MCI nine
and a half years ago.
And, subsequently,
when she was --
became a participant
in the aducanumab trial,
she had a brain scan,
a PET scan,
amyloid plaque on the brain;
and the diagnosis
was changed to Alzheimer's.
As she progressed, our first --
Jerry and I have always
spoken 50/50 until recently,
and her communication is
more challenged at this point.
So she corrects me
whenever I make mistakes
but is often quiet
other than that.
So her diagnosis was not
an easy situation for me.
Jerry is
a professional health --
she has an RN
and an MPH from Columbia
and spent her health,
her career in healthcare.
So -- and she's a double four.
She got a bad gene
from each parent.
So there's a number
of Alzheimer's patients,
people living with the disease
in her family,
so she was not as surprised
by the diagnosis as I was.
-My father was
a practicing surgeon
until about 20 years ago
when a neck injury
which was exacerbated --
which was exacerbated in surgery
required him to step back
from practicing medicine
in that way.
And he founded a center
for the commitment to --
commitment to compassion and
medical care at his hospital,
which involved all sorts
of wonderful programming.
And it was actually out
of that experience
that we started talking
with my college roommate
about putting some of
his writings into a book.
But just as we were getting
into a groove with that,
my father suffered two
strokes three months apart
at the end of 2017.
And that led to a lot
of limitations for my dad
beginning with left neglect.
So while he could see
out of his left side,
he didn't perceive it.
And that meant that
he was at a fall risk.
And that began having
24-hour caregivers with him.
And as if that weren't enough,
a little over a year ago,
on New Year's Eve 2020,
my folks got the double
whammy diagnosis
of Parkinson's
and early stage Alzheimer's.
-Apparently she was
in fairly good spirits.
And we already knew
that there was a dementia
of one kind
or another involved
because she had had this
for about seven years
by the time we got around
to diagnosing.
And mostly that was because
we were considering a facility.
So I think it's harder
when it's your own parent
and you see them like that,
and you're kind of
like more frustrated
because you know they
didn't used to be like that.
And it's more annoying to you
because they --
they're not being
who they used to be.
-So my mother was diagnosed
with Parkinson's
in about 2015, 2016.
And they said to us at that time
that we could expect
that there's about an 80
to 90% correlation
that she would
develop dementia.
What complicated matters
in her situation
was that she was already
cognitively impaired.
So it was hard to judge
what a baseline was and measure
when things were starting --
when the habit onset versus
what was her normal
cognitive impairment.
In addition to her
cognitive impairment,
my mother is Korean,
was Korean;
and English was not her
first language.
And she was not literate in her
native language of Korean.
So she had all these issues
that came out
that impacted
her cognitive state.
So, again, it was really hard
to tell
how much of it was dementia,
how much was progressing,
and how much was just
from normal,
you know, every day
cognitive impairment.
♪♪
Now, I'm here a week, you know,
at best every other month.
It's very different than what
it's like for my mom
who's here all the time.
And she would say her life
is also different
because of these
incredible caregivers
that are also here
with her and with my dad.
But for all the bright spots,
it's -- there's --
you know,
there's a lot of challenges.
And for a man
who was very independent
and was a surgeon
and a clinician and a researcher
and a teacher and a writer
to continue to feel boxed in
by some of these diagnoses
is difficult.
And he'll say that he really
just wants to be of service.
And my father can put on
a very positive front
and try to be in the moment
and count his blessings
and begins every day with
Hebrew blessings for waking up
and for the food on his plate.
And I think from my mother,
who deals with the actuality
of managing caregivers
and doctors
and trying to be his advocate
and trying to figure out
when more
is more and more is not more
and when to stop
pushing so hard, it's a much --
it's a much harder challenge.
It's easy for me
to swoop in and out
and spend quality time
and then whoosh away.
And I think it's much harder
to be the, you know,
online caregiver 24/7.
-I think just allowing myself
to be human
and recognize my limitations...
...is so real and so human
that I think
it's incredibly important
that any caregiver accept
that responsibility willing,
willingly, willing --
-Ly.
-Willingly.
And it's just
the human condition
in its most human form.
-On the occasions now
where I just go to the store
for an hour
or something like that,
I can come back to mayhem.
So that means that somebody
really has to be here.
So that's the biggest
impact right now.
We're getting ready in my office
to go back to work
in the office,
at least part of the week,
starting in April.
So I'm not sure
what I'm going to do
because, on occasion,
I'll be here working.
And, you know,
I'll hear the door click;
and she's gone out to check on
her car to see if she locked it,
or she wants to go get
the trash bins, trash cans in.
And so she will sometimes
not realize
she hasn't kept
the door unlocked.
So if I wasn't here, she would
have just locked herself out.
-There's not enough resources,
I think,
put towards that, the well-being
and the care of the healthcare
provider or the caretaker.
I don't think enough emphasis
is put on that,
that if you're not taking care
of yourself and your well-being,
you're not able to
take care of anybody.
-You were saying recently
that you have just a hard time
even with the word dementia
and Alzheimer's.
Can you talk a little about
why those words feel so hard?
-Because you've spoken
to people
about I've had strokes,
even I have Parkinson's.
But dementia and Alzheimer's
really just --
-It's been hard accepting
my limitations
and wanting just to think
of myself as being limited.
It's been very complicated
for me.
-And especially
something related to the brain.
-Yes.
-Even more so than the body
because with the stroke
and with Parkinson's there
have been movement limitations,
but it seems like the brain,
the cognitive being impacted
has been particularly chilling.
-Quite so.
-Both thing that he does
is he lets me be me.
And he is not ahead of me
or back with me.
He is able to figure out
if he's going too far
or he's being too coddling.
And that allows me to be me.
And we as a couple can continue
to be as much as we possibly
can with the fact being that,
in fact, my brain is different.
There is different thoughts.
And that's --
it takes a bit of work,
and it takes a lot of changing
from both of us.
And -- but that happens,
of course, the course of life.
You know, things happen.
And it doesn't stay
just the same.
♪♪
-The things I like to tell
everybody with the disease
is there's a choice in how
you live with this disease.
You can choose to realize
that you have been given
a number of years ahead of you
that can be joyful, purposeful.
The person with the disease
is somewhat more forgetful.
But, remember,
this is a long-term disease.
Many people live over 10 years,
10 to 15 years or longer.
And the early stage
and mid-stage
can be a wonderful time of life.
And we've been
given a diagnosis,
so that makes every day
more valuable.
So grab it. Choose it.
Live it fully.
Mark things off
your bucket list.
Contribute to others.
I mean, for us,
the most rewarding
and joyful part of this
has been our advocacy
and our ability to help
other individuals with dementia.
-And I so --
the silver lining,
while it sounds really
maybe cold and unfeeling,
to get your affairs
in order soon enough.
You know, do your will.
Do your living will.
Do your MLTS.
Do your power of attorney.
Get your affairs in order.
Make sure that you're living
in a situation
that's the safest
and healthiest for you
and for your family members
and for your loved ones.
I think that's really,
really important.
And you think
there's always time.
Oh, I'll have time to do a will.
I'll have time to do that.
I'll have time to -- you know,
to -- this is too early.
You just can't do it
early enough.
And that's what
I've learned from it
because all the physical stuff,
you can't control.
You know,
you can take medication
up to a certain point,
right, that helped --
that might or might not help,
slow down,
or stabilize your condition.
But you can't control
the acceleration
or the decline of your health
to some extent,
but you can control
some other factors
that might make living with that
situation a little bit easier.
There is some good
in the experience.
Okay. Sounds like it's all awful
and emotionally draining.
But there is some good learnings
from something like this.
It does make you
a more compassionate person.
It does make you question
your mortality
and how do you want to live
the rest of your life
and what's important to you.
And I think that's a good thing.
-I guess the other thing
is to forgive them.
These behaviors
are classic dementia behaviors.
That's what a person
with dementia does.
So forgive them
for having dementia.
It's, you know,
quite likely not their fault.
So that makes things
a little lighter is --
-So one label,
there's not one size fit all.
-I don't think so.
-And I know you want to be
seen in your totality.
-Yes.
-You don't want to be
labeled keys X.
-There are better words
to use.
-Are there better words
that you can think of?
How would you want
someone to talk
about those
cognitive challenges?
-I think that's a great
question,
and I don't know
how to answer that.
-But you're more
than just a label.
-Thank you.
♪♪
-Keep working.
-What else?
-Well, the first thing
I'd say is,
from the bottom
of our hearts, thank you.
I don't think they hear
that nearly often enough.
They're giving parts
of their life,
their careers trying to find
a cure for our granddaughter.
And nothing means
more to us than that.
And so we are tremendously
grateful for researchers
and clinicians and people
who are involved in the field.
And I think as people
who are impacted by the disease,
we need to express
that gratitude
more profoundly and more often.
And, secondly, remember that,
you know, we are a continuum.
But it's a continuum of a
disease, start to late stage.
We have lots of ideas
and advantages,
and we can promote
clinical trials.
And we can help you.
But we're so rarely asked.
We're rarely asked, well,
what are your ideas
about recruiting additional
trial participants?
Or what do you think of this
procedure versus that procedure
if we're designing
the next clinical trial?
Jerry's a brilliant person.
And she didn't
lose her brilliance
when somebody told her
she had MCI.
So I would encourage scientists
to realize
what a wealth of resource
they have in their patients
and in their care partners.
Take advantage of us
by asking us.
Don't hesitate because,
if you don't ask us,
you deny us the opportunity
to feel valuable,
to feel like we can help
to get the positive
psychological benefit
of helping fight
to find a cure.
♪♪
-Thank you to the families
and to the Communications Office
for this wonderful
presentation.
It's very impactful,
very appreciated.
And it just gets to the heart
of the matters that were --
that are important and critical
to this Summit.
I want to now introduce
the scientific chair
of the multiple etiologies
dementias session,
Dr. Kate Possin.
-Thank you.
And, yes.
Thank you
for that inspirational video
and remembering to always
include the patient
and caregiver voice.
So it is with great pleasure
that I introduce the 2022
Draft Recommendations
for Multiple Etiology Dementias.
Next.
Here are my disclosures. Next.
Our committee is focused
on multiple etiology dementias
and also two special topics.
So Post-TBI AD/ADRD is chaired
by Dr. Dams-O'Connor,
and Late is chaired
by Dr. Snyder.
And these will be presented
separately. Next.
So before we review
the draft recommendations,
I will overview
what our session covers
and why MED research
is crucial.
In dementia, multiple
or mixed underlying ideologies
is the norm.
More than 50% of people
diagnosed with Alzheimer's
have pathologic evidence of more
than one cause of dementia.
If we are going to accurately
diagnose and treat Alzheimer's,
we need to understand
these contributing pathologies,
including how they
can be identified,
treated,
and even prevented.
We must continue
to advance research
on differential diagnosis,
treatments for people with
multiple etiology dementias,
basic science on common and
interacting disease mechanisms,
and training in different
dementia syndromes.
In the AD ADRD field,
some critical research gaps
apply across all etiologies
and are subsumed
also in the MED session.
This includes advancing work
on early detection,
caregiver support,
and data harmonization. Next.
In 2019, TDP-43 and common
dementia is now termed LATE,
and TBI and AD ADRD
risk were emerging topics.
And these -- this year, these
are included in the MED session
but with separate
subcommittees. Next.
So here's the list
of the committee members
who have worked hard
over the last six months
to prepare draft recommendations
that we seek
your input on today.
Our charge is to recommend
research on mixed etiologies
and key themes that apply
across all etiologies.
Next.
so now I will introduce you
to the focus areas of MED,
starting with detect
and diagnose.
More than 50% of people living
with dementia are not diagnosed
until moderate to advanced
stages of dementia.
And these delays are longest
for race and ethnic minorities.
People with symptomatic
cognitive decline
need an evaluation
with quality follow-up care.
Furthermore, too often the
dementia diagnosis is generic,
such as unspecified dementia,
which is a huge problem
as we move towards an era
of disease modifying therapies.
We need scalable solutions
to achieve accurate
and timely ideological diagnosis
in diverse populations.
Interventions and treatment,
we recommend research
that moves forward promising
interventions and treatments
that address modifiable risks
to prevent cognitive decline
and that support persons
living with dementia
and care partners
to maximize quality of life.
Basic science,
MED is the norm among
older adults with dementia.
Although basic science research
often focuses
on a single etiology,
there have been substantial
advancements in understanding,
interacting, and common
mechanisms of mixed pathologies.
Continued work in this area
is crucial
if we're going to develop
accurate methods to diagnose
and to treat these diseases.
Next.
Workforce, MED recommends
work to address gaps
in the dementia clinical
and research workforce.
We need to develop, implement,
and evaluate training programs
in different dementia syndromes
for health professionals.
We need to incentivize
mentorship
and provide opportunities
for new researchers,
particularly from groups
underrepresented in science.
Furthermore, it is crucial
that we promote
and support researchers
to recruit and retain diverse
cohorts in all types of studies.
Harmonization is a new
proposed focus in 2022.
The goal of this focus area is
to maximize the impact of data
collected to address
important questions in MED.
Our session is recommending
for the first time
that we incentivize
and conduct research
to improve data harmonization
and sharing practices
across MED studies. Next.
Infused through all of these
five focus areas of MED
is the requirement
that research be inclusive.
For us to make meaningful
progress towards NAPA goals,
we must conduct
inclusive science.
There's been
increasing attention
and work in recent years
to address the problem that
our research participant samples
are frequently
not representative.
For example, Black,
African-American, Latino,
other minority groups
are insufficiently included.
And this means
that our interpretations
are also not inclusive.
This is particularly concerning
given that some minority
populations,
including Blacks,
African-Americans,
and Latinos are at a greater
risk for dementia.
Our committee recommends that
all MED research be conducted
in a way that is culturally
sensitive and relevant
to the populations
that suffer from MED
so that everyone will have
the potential
to benefit from the advances.
The requirement
that MED research
be inclusive
of diverse populations
is central to all of
the recommendations
that we present today.
Next.
So here's a summary of the MED
draft recommendations.
Focus area 1,
detection and diagnosis
of cognitive impairment in MED.
You will hear from Mike Wolf
and Jeffrey Burns
about our recommendations
to improve
the detection
of cognitive impairment,
to evaluate cognitive screening,
and to support
the identification
of multiple etiologies.
You will hear from Malú Tansey
on our recommendations
to advance basic science
research on the common
and interacting risk factors
and mechanisms.
For Focus Area 3, you will hear
from Ozioma Okonkwo
and myself
on our recommendations
to advance interventions
and treatments.
And, last, you'll hear
from Heather Snyder
on Focus Area 4,
dementia capable workforce;
and Focus Area 5,
data harmonization.
So now I have the pleasure
of introducing Michael Wolf
from the Northwestern Feinberg
School of Medicine,
who will present
on Focus Area 1. Next.
-Good morning.
As the slide states,
I have no relevant disclosures.
And I will be talking
about recommendations 1 and 2.
Next.
And next.
So Recommendation 1,
which has been flagged
as of the highest priority
at this summit since 2016,
addresses the need
for interventions
that promote objective detection
of cognitive impairment
linked to quality care
whenever a patient,
care partner, or clinician
reports cognitive,
behavioral,
or functional changes.
An emphasis is specifically
placed on strategies
at the frontlines of healthcare
including primary care
and other everyday
clinical settings.
It should be stressed
that interventions must focus
not only on improving detection
but also follow-up activities
including referral,
diagnosis, care planning,
and ongoing management
of any impairment
or identified cognitive
functional change.
The need is also heightened
among populations
experiencing health
disparities in ADRD.
Therefore, research should
prioritize these communities.
Next.
Recognition 1
and being flagged
at the highest priority
is well-justified.
Despite long-standing
opportunities,
including the Medicare
annual wellness visit,
rates of detection, particularly
in primary care settings,
remain very low.
This is especially true
for early detection of ADRD
with mild cognitive impairment.
And there are many root
causes steeped
in the reality
of typical clinical workflows.
Primary care practices
often have limited resources
in terms of staffing
and time with patients.
But, also, there's a lack
of training
and awareness
on the availability
and use of various
cognitive assessments.
Further, the presence
of comorbidities
may mask the detection
of cognitive, behavioral,
or functional changes
warranting further assessment.
As with the past
two ADRD summits,
there continues to be
an urgent need
for objective
cognitive assessments
that are amenable for use
in primary care settings,
brief in nature, tethered
to electronic health records,
with easily interpretable
and actionable findings,
again, linking to quality care
with TRNKE recommendations.
These are
desperately needed. Next.
I'd also like to highlight
a recent study
that underscores
the presence of disparities
particularly among Asian, Black,
and Hispanic Latinx
older adults.
So when colleagues leveraged
California Medicare data
and found that disparities
among these groups,
Asian, Black,
and Hispanic adults,
were less likely to receive
a timely diagnosis;
and Asian adults
specifically received
fewer diagnostic elements.
This underscores
the recommendations
priority studying
among health --
studies among health
desperate populations. Next.
In response to this
recommendation set forth
at the 2016 ADRD Summit,
NINDS immediately took action
with a request for applications,
forming the
Detect Cognitive Impairment
Including Dementia Consortium
or DetectCID.
This is led by Dr.
Corriveau and Dr Hummer.
And I'd also like to acknowledge
Dr. Claudia Moyes' role
in consortium's creation
as well.
DetectCID was founded in 2017
as a network
of research programs
validating strategies
in everyday clinical settings,
including primary care that
include cognitive assessments
linked to quality care.
The goal is to improve
both the frequency
and quality
of cognitive evaluations
and to better understand
the various barriers
to routine detection,
especially among populations
experiencing health disparities.
Dr. Possin and her team
serve as a coordinating site
for this consortium. Next.
There are three paradigms
currently include
in the DetectCID --
I'm sorry. Next.
You know, the three
current programs in DetectCID,
you can see the actual --
the partners here.
They each have their own
paradigm being tested
in diverse settings.
All seek to have as brief
as possible assessments,
whenever possible,
less than 10 minutes
and even, ideally,
shorter than seven minutes,
tethered to electronic
health record
and, again, with turnkey
recommendations. Next.
In the fall of 2021, NINDS
made another commitment
to extend and expand
the DetectCID consortium
with an RFA
linked to this recommendation,
providing a five-year renewal
within a UL 1 mechanism.
This time the consortium
will focus
on pragmatic clinical trials;
testing paradigms based
in everyday clinical settings,
including primary care
to improve detection
of cognitive impairment
with a mandate
to target populations
experiencing disparities.
These pragmatic trials
will also seek to evaluate
not just the effectiveness
of early detection
and management strategies
but their fidelity as well.
Next. Of note,
a soon-to-be-released article
shared many of
the early learnings
across the consortium partners
with regards to the lessons
learned on hardwiring
early detection
strategies in primary care.
One particular challenge,
especially in community
health center settings,
that may disproportionately
provide care
to help disparate populations
is the need to identify pathways
for primary care clinicians
in terms of doing
the diagnostic workup,
referral and later ongoing
care management of adults
with suspected impairment.
Next.
Moving on to Recommendation 2,
this is set at priority 4
with a focus over the next five
to seven years,
addressing the needs
for improving our understanding
of the benefits, burdens,
and harms of screening
for cognitive impairment.
Specifically, in the absence
of a patient
care partner
or clinician report
of cognitive, behavioral,
or functional changes.
A strong emphasis is yet again
placed on the importance
of having any
early detection strategy
linked to diagnostic services
and quality care.
In addition, research studies
should be able to determine
whether certain populations
are more likely to benefit
from screening as well
as whether other populations
may be more likely to be harmed.
Next.
The justification for
Recommendation 2 flows directly
From the US
Preventive Services Task Force
continued I or insufficient
evidence recommendation
made as recently
as February 2020,
with regard to cognitive
screening. Next.
The primary reason
was that, in fact,
there continues to be
very limited data
investigating benefits and harms
of cognitive screening.
One trial by Fowler
and colleagues
was recently conducted,
finding no differences
in quality of life
among those who did or did
not receive screening.
Prior to the Fowler study,
scant evidence
has been available
to further inform
the Task Force.
Other justifications for the
lack of endorsement of cognitive
screening includes the lack of
accurate well-tested instruments
for assessing
cognitive impairment
that would work
in primary care settings
and that there also
is little evidence
supporting any benefit
from screening
or any earlier diagnosis
on decision-making.
Yet there's also mixed evidence
on potential harms
due to false positives derived
from diagnostic inaccuracies.
Next.
Interestingly, we do have
a natural experiment
brewing with the Medicare
annual wellness visit.
These covered primary care
encounters have been around
since 2011 and require
a cognitive assessment.
So, in essence,
despite the US
Preventive Services
Task Force recommendations,
there is a cognitive
screening mandate.
However,
Medicare wellness visits
are often not performed
for a myriad of reasons.
And, when they are performed,
as many as half may not include
the required
cognitive assessment.
A prior Alzheimer's
Association survey
found one in five
primary care doctors
were unaware
that such a Medicare visit
required
a cognitive screening,
this after several years
of Medicare annual wellness
visit being in place next.
Finally, as we move forward,
an important take-home
to reiterate
is the need
to develop strategies
for early detection
of cognitive impairment
that will not widen
existing disparities
by not having adequate linkages
to quality care
and clear recommendations
for ongoing follow-up
and care management.
Partnerships,
partnerships with CMS
and other large health systems
might also expedite answers
for Recommendation 2
by examining the Medicare
annual wellness visit data.
Thank you.
-Alright. Great.
So how I'm Jeff Burns,
thanks Mike.
I am going to
discuss recommendation
three in this focus area
about detecting
and diagnosing
cognitive impairment
in multi-etiology dementia.
I do have a couple disclosures,
I've done some consultation
for a couple of companies
and I lead
some clinical trials
as site PI for a number
of different companies.
Next.
So this recommendation,
recommendation three,
is about moving forward,
clinical
and translational research
as opposed to basic science
which we'll hear about next.
But clinical
and translational research
focused on identifying
the multi-etiologies of dementia
in diverse populations.
Next slide.
So, we know and we're, I believe
the field is really beginning
to embrace
this idea of heterogeneity
of Alzheimer's and dementia,
as a multi-etiology dementia
which heard about it
today and yesterday.
But we know
there's multiple interacting
and co-occurring
pathologies.
These are the classic ones
we look at. Next.
This study here
from the Rush Group from 2013
reminds us that
we can't really see
and count everything
that's related
to the common
neurodegenerative pathology,
or actually late life
cognitive decline.
So this study identified
about 41% of the variants
that explains the late life
cognitive decline
through pathology.
But, what remains is about
60% of the variants of late life
cognitive decline
that's unexplained by these,
you know, more common
neurodegenerative pathologies.
It reminds us
we really can't see
and count everything
that's related
to these late
life dementia's.
Next slide.
And go ahead again.
And another study from the same
group in 2019 on individuals
who are diagnosed
with Alzheimer's Disease
clinically found
that really the,
from a neuropathological
perspective,
these dementia's
can be attributed
to a variety
of common neuropathologies.
So, reminding us that when
we think it's Alzheimer's,
that the things that we can
count are multiple
and overlapping.
And hence the need for thinking
about dementia
in these broader terms
in multi-etiologies. Next.
So, back to the recommendation
of, you know,
how do we identify these
multi-etiologies of dementia
in diverse populations?
My recommendation
is to really promote
and grow
the observational studies
that include
multi-modal, deep phenotyping.
So that we can begin
to understand,
better understand clinical
phenotypes and biomarkers
and how those predict and relate
to the neuropathologies
and combinations
of neuropathologies.
We need to identify risk factors
for these pathologies,
prevalence estimates and how sex
and genetic factors relate.
And importantly we need
to understand the life course.
Including social
determinants of health,
and I'll talk about
that more in a second,
but, we need to focus
also on populations
most at risk for Alzheimer's
Disease and related dementia's,
including as we've heard
already this morning racial
and ethnic minorities
that appear to be more at risk.
And groups such
as Downs Syndrome.
Next slide.
So, we need to, we need to build
this idea out more as well,
this life course
model of dementia.
So this came from
the Lancet Commissions
Report in 2020 on dementia
prevention,
intervention and care.
And focused on
the 12 risk factors,
12 strongest risk factors.
And how they influence dementia
risks across the life course.
So that backwards s is a figure
that shows the risk factors
and their apparent roles
in dementia
risks across the life course.
And we need to build
this idea out more,
really begin to understand
better how the environment,
how social determinants
of health,
and other factors
across the lifespan
interact with genetics
and influence
an individuals risk
of developing dementia
late in life.
Next slide.
And a reminder
that it's not to early
to begin to move these ideas
into primary care,
we just heard about that
from Mike as well.
But, and this is beginning
to happen already,
this scientific statement from
the American Heart Association
from last year
was recommendations
for how to move
many of these ideas
into primary care practice.
And so, primary care physicians
are interested
and beginning to use
these ideas in practice,
we need to accelerate that.
Next slide.
So how do we do that?
Well we need to continue
to validate
these multi
biomarker approaches,
really understand and validate
how they predict
and relate
to these neuropathologies.
And importantly we need
to do research to understand
how they influence
clinical practice.
What signs and symptoms
best identify these etiologies.
And are they
clinically actionable?
Can we identify and stratify,
can we identify these factors
or stratify individuals
into risk groups to target them
with disease specific therapies?
And lastly, we need
to think hard about access
to these new diagnostics
and new therapies.
And then how do we scale them
to the population
so they reach everybody
who needs them?
We need to do this
through more pragmatic trials
and community-based trials.
And we need to focus again
as we've heard yesterday
and today,
on reducing inequities
and reducing poor access
to these new therapies
and new diagnostics.
And next slide.
And this headline is a reminder
of why we need to do that.
We can't develop new diagnostics
and new treatments
that deepen
these inequities of care.
And last slide, just to bring
it back to the big picture.
The recommendation three,
set at a priority three
is to conduct
multi-modal clinical
and translational research
that supports the identification
of these multiple ideologies
in diverse populations.
And so now I'll turn it over
to Malu Gamez Tansey
who's going to talk
about basic research in MED.
-Thank you Jeff.
Thank you
for your time everybody.
The focus area two
for basic research in MED,
recommendation four,
priority two to advance
basic research on a common
and interacting risk factors and
mechanisms of multiple etiology
cognitive impairment in dementia
in diverse populations.
Was put together
by contributions
from Dr. Brad Hyman
and Lea Grinberg.
Next slide.
You see our disclosures
and there are several.
So I won't read through them.
We will go to the next slide
and start the recommendation.
Again, under that
main recommendation
we have four
sub-recommendations.
And they are to define
the interactions
at the molecular
and cellular level of the common
and newly identify
pathobiologies of MED.
To define
the molecular signatures
of vulnerable versus resilient
neuronal populations.
To incentivize innovation,
to address technological gaps
and to incentivize creation
of multidisciplinary,
multi-sector,
multi-career stage teams
to address
both the heterogeneity
and the common mechanism
questions of MED.
And in the next few slides
I'm going to show you
the progress towards these four
sub-recommendations
and where we still need
to do more.
So, the first thing you see
is that research efforts
to advance basic science
since the 2019 summit
have involved of course
the four main proteins.
Tau, alpha-synuclein,
TDP43 and amyloid beta.
And we know that the mechanisms
of toxicity of these proteins
involve the organization,
their propagation
and there's an,
if there's an imbalance
in the synthesis aggregation
or clearance of these proteins
in can result
in chronic accumulation
that leads to further
aggregation, and propagation
and potentially interactions
with inflammation,
eventually neurodegeneration.
That's the model
that everybody's testing.
However, in the next slide
you will see
that it gets very complex
because we see
that they are different
strains of these seeds.
And so, in the seminal work
by John Trojanwoski
and Virginia Lee,
where they showed that there
were unique pathological
tau conformers from brain
that could transmit
in non-transgenic mice.
We now know from work
of Michelle Goddard
and other investigators
including a review
from Kejal Ashul
that the complexity
of these amyloid strains
is very very high.
And interestingly enough
from the work
of Brad Hyman
and Safar's group,
we see that
this molecular diversity
may contribute to clinical
heterogeneity in AD
and may be associated with
rapidly progressing Alzheimer's.
And so, and on the next slide
what you will see is this idea
that we may not be able
to get away with
just targeting
one of these,
we may have to think
about combination immunotherapy
and as well as targeting
the inflammation
that comes from
these interactions.
And finally there's a new kid
in town and that's TM106B,
which was recently reported
by Michelle Goddard's group.
That forms AIDS
dependent amyloid filaments
in human brain.
And then the next slide
what you will see
and I'd like to highlight
is that,
targeting tau is not just
about immunotherapy,
there are other
non-immunotherapy approaches
such as anti-sense oligose from
Tim Muller's group back in 2017
and also from Brad Hyman's
group the, a way to repress tau
is by using zinc-finger
protein nucleases
that will, you know,
repress the transcription
and formation of tau.
And in the next slide
I'd like to highlight
basically that one of
the seminal discoveries
since the last summit
and expanded upon is,
linking tau to immunity
and lipid biology.
Much of this work has come
from the lab of David Holtzman.
Where they tied ApoE4
to exacerbation
of tomigated neurodegeneration
in mouse models.
Followed by linking it
to interactions
between APOE and TRIM2.
And finally a very recent report
that implicates
the glymphatic system
and that clearance
of extracellular tau
and protection again
Tau aggregation.
And then in the next slide
I would like to highlight
the fact that we know
as well that in addition
to these protein apathies
there are
incidental copathologies
that co-occur
with neurodegeneration.
But the consequences
are unknown.
Some of these
may impact cognition
and some may protect
against spread.
So there's much work
to be done in this area.
And in the next slide
we'd like to highlight
that there's been good progress
in implicating immunity
in lipid processing
with genetic loci.
And this is important
because all the geneticists need
to have it grounded in genes
in order to really understand
that it's important.
And so this is a good advance
in my book and many other books.
There's also the importance
of the gut,
brain microbiome access,
where we know that
there are bacteria
that produce short-chain
fatty acids
and those may be associated
with protection
against early onset
of certain forms of dementia.
In the next slide we'd like
to highlight the fact
that there's been lots of
advances in the next slide,
in iPSCs or select vulnerability
for understanding
that in any kind of injury
the cell type matters.
Because it will,
the degree of dysfunction
depends on which cell
is injured.
And for instance
excitatory neurons
can be more prone
to accumulate tau and die
compared to, you know,
other subtypes if they're,
you know, if they're not
a certain phenotype.
And so in the next slide
we also know
that there are advances
in iPSCs in the next slide.
That have been important,
but, they're limited by the fact
that not everybody's growing
them in two and 3D culture.
And so, the phenotype
is forward with iPSC work
that they're grown
in the proper environment
so that we know
that they are more closely
recapitulating
their normal allele.
And more importantly we also
need to stress that with,
the development of iPSC lines
from individuals
with diverse genetic backgrounds
and diverse ethnic
backgrounds is needed.
And in the next slide
we need to integrate
everything into
a o-mix approach.
So that we know the genome,
the transcriptome,
the proteome and the metabolome
all come together
into a systems
biology scenario
where team science
is really the way to go.
And so, as we integrate these
various aspects of basic science
into a holistic systems
biology approach,
we'll be able to really
understand the pathogenesis
and the pathobiology
of AD and MED.
And in the next slide,
is an example
of what some of this,
that has occurred,
like Move AD,
is a huge partnership
between NIH,
industry, non-profit
organizations involving,
you know, lots of labs
with complimentary projects.
And importantly it builds
on the open science approach
and big data infrastructure
established by the AMP AD.
And it's a real example
of science being a team sport.
And in the next slide
are just a few examples of FOAs
that have come out
since 2019.
Especially in the bottom
highlighting,
you know, one of the centers
that was funded with this FOA,
which is the Office of Nuclear
Strains in the business lab.
As well as the more recent
Center Without Walls
to address mechanisms
of degeneration in FTD.
And in the next slide
I just want to summarize
basically what we are saying
in the four sub-recommendations.
The areas of focus
are the proteinopathy,
inflammaging and immuno
essence interactions
that lead to cognitive decline
in diverse populations.
And understanding
those mechanisms.
Second, understanding
the mechanisms of cell
vulnerability and resilience
in diverse populations
and how they interact
with neurodegeneration.
Third, we need to incentivize
the development of iPSC lines
in two and 3D environments
and from individuals
with diverse
ethnic backgrounds.
And finally we need
to incentivize basic research
by diverse multidisciplinary,
multi-sector,
multi-career stage individuals
and teams.
Such as the CWOS.
And I will pass it on to Doctors
Okonkwo and Doctors Possin.
Thank you.
-Thank you so much.
That has been wonderful so far.
So now we're going trying
to focus area trade
is focused on interventions
and treatments.
And I'm going to be
delivering recommendation five.
And Dr. Possin
is going to take six.
Next slide please.
I have no disclosures
for this talk. Next slide.
So for this recommendation
the focus as mentioned earlier
is conducting
clinical studies on approved
or promising
interventions and treatments
to mitigate risk
for cognitive decline.
And under here
we have three elements
that you're going to be
hearing more about
in the subsequent slides.
But, in summary the key elements
are focused on conducted,
inclusive and pragmatic
clinical trials.
Supporting the development
of practice-based
research networks.
And develop within health risks
and effectiveness of hierarchies
in diverse populations.
Next slide.
This recommendation
was first introduced
in the last ADRD summit in 2019.
And in the years since then
the progress report
that was shared with
the scientific community in 2021
indicated that there has been
several research milestones
that have been accomplished.
And some of
the highlights of that,
or a focus on post-stroke
vascular contributions
to cognitive impairment
and dementia
was released as a u19.
And consequent
on that area of then,
the diverse VCID project
was initiated
that was under still led
by Angela and the colleague.
And also as part
of the accomplishment
also the discoveries
and study
that is focused
on post-stroke cognitive
outcomes led by Natalia Rost
and Steve Greenberg
is now underway.
So there's been remarkable
progress made under this effort
to conduct intervention
studies up until now.
Next slide please.
And in thinking about then the,
where we wanted to take this
for the 2022
updates for this summit.
This happened
against the backdrop
of two recent developments.
You already saw this slide
in Jeff Burns talk.
And this is the dementia
prevention reports
from the Lancet Commission.
And which identified some very
key risk factors for dementia.
And these risk factors
then can now be understood
as potential targets
that we can hit in order
to forestall the projected
increases in dementia prevalence
and incidents
in the coming years.
Next slide.
And the second development
is at the end of last year
we received,
well we all received an update
from the National Plans
for Addressing Alzheimer's
and Disease.
And in that update a new goal
was added to the plan.
And this goal
was specific developing
and promoting health agent
and with this risk factors
for AD.
Which was a very interesting
and exciting development
given that the targets
and for not all along
has been to prevent AD by 2025.
Which also is why in this
2022 version of the ADRD Summit,
recommendation five
has now been moved
from priority two
to priority one.
Given the imminence
of the deadline
we all have of preventing AD.
So this focus on reducing
risk factors
we believe is very timely
and informed the operation
that we took the recommendation
five on interventions.
Next slide please.
So the first element
under this recommendation five
is the conduct of inclusive
and pragmatic clinical trials.
In settings where risk factors
for cognitive decline
can be appropriately targeted
for intervention.
A search of clinical trials
that's dove, earlier days,
reveal that in the ten years
between 2001 and 2011.
Approximately 450 studies
in dementia studies
that were focus on dementia.
None of them had the keyword
pragmatic associated with them.
First four, ten years
and there the last decade,
the number of intervention
studies focused on dementia
have exploded thanks to
the massive inclusion of firms
to ADRD studies.
However, of this I am more
than 1,000 studies known
that are focused on dementia,
only 25 of them
have the word pragmatic
and attached to them
as a keyword.
So obviously in this were
some progress has been made
in a greater recognition
for the need
for cognitive clinical trials.
And there is still a lag
and opportunities for the field
to begin to think more in terms
of conducting studies
in the settings
where the people who actually
are going to be
impacted the most
by these trials.
Actually are look at
where they live, work and play.
However though,
despite that it's also
important to underscore
the progress
has continued to be made.
And on this slide we highlight
some of the big studies
that have been,
that are currently occurring
or have been underway
in the last decade in the area
of both pharmacological
and non-pharmacological
treatments
and interventions for ADRDs.
We highlight the A4
and the head studies.
Which are anti-angular therapies
focused on individuals
who currently are
cognitively unimpaired.
We also highlight the Hope
for MCI study.
Which as the name indicates is
focused on individuals with MCI.
And this study is focused
on addressing people
hypocampal, hyperactivation.
And then the Libit Study
that is focused on individuals
in the dementia stage
of the disease.
And this target is to understand
the role that CBD and THC
might play in the present
agitation in dementia.
For the
non-pharmacological treatments
we highlight the exert study,
the mind study,
the achieve study
and the US Plan Study.
And we think that the
non-pharmacological treatments
help make more progress
in beginning to think
about how soon interventions
within communities
that actually are going
to be impacted
by the outcomes
of this study.
For example the exert study
and the US Plan Study
partnered with community-based
organizations like the YMCAs
to actually conduct
the intervention pieces
of the studies
within the community
where individuals are located.
So the exert study
is an exercise study,
the mind study
is focused on diet,
the achieve study is focused
on treating hearing loss
and the US Plan Study
is a multi-domain study
that includes exercise, diets,
cognitive stimulation
and also health coaching.
Next slide.
The second element
of recommendation five
is focused on supporting
the development
of practice-based
research networks.
To facilitate a translation
of effective assessment
and intervention strategies
into practice at a large scale.
And we think that this is truly
a place where the NIA
and the NDS has made tremendous,
tremendous progress.
As you can see
that there are now
a number of versioning
practice-based research networks
that have been developed
to support the conduct
of pragmatic clinical trials
and other community-based
type studies.
On this slide you will see
that we have also highlighted
the NIA Intramural Center
for Alzheimer's
and Related Dementia's,
CARD.
CARD as you may know
is the NINDS,
NIA crown jewel
if I may use that word.
But currently it is focused
on the conduct of basic science
and data science.
We would like to suggest
that CARD is uniquely positioned
for serving as a hub
for intervention studies.
Perhaps in partnerships
with practice-based
research networks.
Next slide please.
And then the last element
of this recommendation five
is to evaluate health risks and
effectiveness of AD therapies.
Such as anti-amyloid therapies
and more patients
from diverse culture
and socioeconomic backgrounds.
The topic of inclusion
and equity
was the focus
of an entire session yesterday.
And we already have heard a lot
about it this morning
from my colleagues.
But just in highlight form,
we all understand and appreciate
that ADRD more prevalent
in minoritized groups.
However, a recent survey
in 2020 of nine
of the large scale observational
and clinical studies
in the ADRD field
indicated that the vast
majority of participants
who enrolled in these studies
are not Hispanic whites.
More recently a few months ago,
another survey that this focused
on drug trials
in the ADRD space,
indicated that about 95%
of all the participants
in these studies again
were not Hispanic whites.
So I think, you know,
it is certainly obvious to say
that this statistical
is no longer tenable.
And the field has a moral
and ethical impurity
to begin to move the middle.
Next slide please.
And again, you know, this is now
reflected in some book
lay and scientific articles
like the one by Jan Manley
and her colleague.
Addressing the,
and developments in lab
and how the lack of diversity
in the patient group
is something that needs
to become to new to be explored
as this trial,
as this drug move
towards further community
and developments.
Next slide please.
So what then are our next steps?
And I want to focus
on the three key elements
on this recommendation.
The first one
being intervention.
We want to call attention
that there is need to look
at the settings in which these
studies are being conducted.
And also the modalities
and the majority of studies in,
are still single
modality studies.
But as you heard, you know,
in Jeff Burns talk,
you know,
it is the rare occasion
that an individual with AD
at autopsy
only has AD as a neuropathology.
So want to begin to think more
in terms of more
multi-modal studies.
Also in terms of targets,
the most prevalence
and hierarchies studies for ADRD
are at this point
focused on anti-amyloid.
And we want to highlight
that it is time for the field
to begin to pay
more specific attention
to the other part
of it physiologist
that underlie ADRDs.
And that's the different
populations of interest
is an area to consider.
We want to highlight the need
to expand the spectrum
from individuals
who are cognitively unimpaired,
all the way to individuals
who have dementia.
In terms of infrastructure
we believe that there is a need
not only for an increased
development of PBRNs,
the practice-based
research networks,
but also for an increased
use of those networks.
Because it is critical
that as disparities
and interventions
are being developed,
that they are housed
within the areas
where the people
who are going to be
using the outcomes of these
studies where they live,
work and play.
And finally, you know,
we think that there is a need
to continue to pay attention
to issues of representation.
And this is going to require us
to be very critical
of the inclusion
and exclusion criteria.
That we implement
in these studies.
Because that is actually
the first place
that we begin
to exclude individuals
who actually are most affected
by these diseases.
I want to leave you then
with some resources in terms of
funding opportunities
that people can apply
for in order to begin
to propose interventions.
Both from a pharmacological
and non-pharmacological ones.
And we want to call
specific attention
to the very last bullet there.
The request for information
on capacity and support.
That the NIH, sorry that the NIA
has released to receive
information from the community
in terms of how the NIA
can build some community-based
research networks.
To increase the participation
of diverse groups
in ADRD clinical trials.
And I believe
that is my last slide
and I'd like to hand it off now
to my colleague Dr. Kate Possin.
Thank you.
-Okay thank you so much.
Great, so I'm going to be
presenting recommendation six.
Which is to implement
and evaluate outcomes
for effective
dementia care programs
that support persons living with
dementia and their caregivers.
Including those of socially,
ethnically and racially
diverse populations.
This recommendation
includes advancing research
to identify
barriers and facilitators
to widespread diffusion
of promising interventions,
conducting implementation
studies,
developing and evaluating
payment models and developing
and evaluating core components
of culturally sensitive
collaborative dementia
care models,
that deliver
high quality care. Next.
So I'll start
by setting the context
for this recommendation
with a quote from Julia,
a person living with early
stage Alzheimer's Disease.
It took us nearly four years
to get a diagnosis.
The doctor told us
it was Alzheimer's,
that there was nothing
he could do
and to come back in a year.
We were first devastated
then angry.
I also have diabetes,
I got medication, education
and care management
for that.
Now I have a fatal brain disease
and I got diagnosed and adios.
We have to do better.
So we, those of you who were
at the health equity session
yesterday
also heard from Mr. Lacina
during the question
and answer period,
a caregiver who highlighted
the importance
of transparent
disclosure of diagnosis.
And prognosis and of guiding
caregivers into their role.
And we started today with those
poignant inspirational videos
of people living with dementia
and their caregivers.
That also highlighted
the importance
of supporting the caregiver.
Planning ahead,
getting affairs in order
and focusing on well-being.
Next.
Yet dementia care is too often
crisis oriented and fragmented.
Frequent emergency department
visits and hospitalizations,
multiple care transitions,
inappropriate
and potentially
harmful medication use.
Patients experience
aggressive end of life care
that's often inconsistent
with their values and expensive.
Informal caregivers
shoulder substantial burdens
with minimal support
from our patient-centric
healthcare models.
And when caregivers
are depressed,
people living with dementia use
the emergency department more.
The COVID-19 pandemic
has disproportionately disrupted
the lives of people living with
dementia and their caregivers.
Next.
In 2019
this ADRD specific milestone
was given two success criteria.
They were,
to write a white paper
on proven dementia
care programs.
That effectively support persons
with dementia
and their caregivers.
And to establish
a national consortium
tasked with applied research
to determine how to implement
widely across the country
in everyday care settings,
proving care programs.
The first of these milestones
has been completed
and I will now
share the results. Next.
A systematic review of dementia
care models was produced by AHRQ
at the request of NIA.
And this review evaluated the
evidence that care models were,
that which care models
were ready
for broad dissemination
and implementation.
This report was followed
by a consensus study report
by the National Academy's
of Science,
Engineering and Medicine.
Together these reports
provide a helpful overview
of the evidence landscape.
And they concluded
that evidence is sufficient
to justify implementation
of two types of interventions
in a broad spectrum of community
settings with evaluation
conducted to continue
expanding the evidence-base.
These are collaborative
care models
and multi-component
caregiver support. Next.
So collaborative care models
use multidisciplinary teams
to coordinate psychosocial
and medical care.
Typically with a care navigator,
or care manager as the primary
point of contact for the family.
They emphasize the immediate
needs of the person
living with dementia
and the caregiver.
Often called a diad.
And they also prioritized
proactive care planning,
personalized to the diad.
So these programs have been
shown to improve quality of life
for the person living
with dementia,
caregiver well-being,
health system level markers,
including improvements
in quality indicators
and reducing emergency
room visits. Next.
Multi-component
caregiver support provides
caregivers with the knowledge,
skills and access
to resources they need
to promote their own well-being
as well as that of the person
living with dementia
for whom they care.
And outcomes improved include
caregiver depression. Next.
So we know
that collaborative care
and multi-component
caregiver support models
improve outcomes for people
living with dementia
and their families.
Yet these programs
remain unavailable
to the vast majority.
Scientists have a critical role
in bridging the science
practice gap.
Too often scientists expect
that the implementation
and dissemination
of their interventions
will be taken up
by other parties.
Which is often not the case.
And as scientists need
to understand the barriers
to dissemination
effective dementia care
and trial implementation methods
to bridge the gap.
Next.
So in closing,
please imagine with me
a near future
of dementia care.
Imagine if every patient was a
concern for cognitive decline
is evaluated, giving appropriate
treatment, connected to care.
Imagine that once diagnosed
with dementia
and their caregivers have
someone in the medical system
who helps navigate them
through the challenges
of living with dementia.
The medical system
partners with caregivers,
prepares them for their role.
Tailors support to their needs
and preferences.
Quality of life, well-being,
for both the person
with dementia
and the caregiver,
are made a priority.
We can do this. Next.
I would now like
to introduce Heather Snyder
from the Alzheimer's
Association.
Who will close our presentation
with the last two focus areas.
-Thank you so much
and hi everybody
and I think building
on all of the presentations
that you've heard today,
the last two focus areas
really are all encompassing
of those recommendations.
Thinking about a dementia
capable workforce
and data harmonization.
Next slide.
In terms of my disclosures
I'm a full-time employee
of the Alzheimer's Association.
Next slide.
So looking at
the first recommendation
or the first focus area,
the dementia capable workforce
and specifically
recommendation seven,
priority two.
I'm promoting education,
training on multiple etiology
cognitive impairment
and dementia to increase
the dementia capable workforce.
Advanced researchers including
from groups underrepresented
in science and foster includes
their research practices.
There's a number of components
within this recommendation,
but really to set
the stage of the need
and we heard a little bit
in the session yesterday,
the healthy equity session
by Dr. Medina,
Doctors Medina and Dr. Gilsanz.
The next slide.
In the world today
the global population is aging.
By 2030 one in six individuals
in the world
will be age 60 and over
and you can see some of
the other statistics
that are listed here.
Alzheimer's Disease
International estimates
that today there are more than
55 million individuals
living with dementia
in the global world.
And the reason
Facts and Figures
reports that there are more
than six million Americans
that are living
with Alzheimer today,
not to mention the full
spectrum of dementia.
Next slide.
What we do look at when, in a
number of different studies,
in a number
of different reviews,
have looked at the dementia
care specialists.
So those that were
within the workforce
that are poised to provide
the care and support
and really make
that linkage of care
into research and back again.
And so whether you're looking
at primary care physicians,
whether you're looking
at geriatricians
or practicing
geriatricians that,
and neurologists
with dementia expertise,
or whether you're looking
at licensed nurse practitioners
in the United States
with either an expertise
in geriatric care
or dementia.
There is a serious shortfall
and this is something
that when we think
about the workforce,
whether we're talking
about care,
whether we're talking
about research
and really the intersection
of the two,
is certainly a gap in where
we are as a community
and as a field.
Next slide.
And in fact when you look
at the number of states that,
across the country that are
lacking dementia care experts,
or specialists, you can see
that listed here
that the number of practicing
geriatricians needs to increase
at least five times by 2050
in order to take care
of the individuals
with Alzheimer's
and other dementia.
And in fact 55, the recent
Facts and Figures Report suggest
that 55%
of primary care physicians
that are caring for individuals
with Alzheimer's
and other dementia,
report that there are not
enough dementia care specialists
in their community.
Next slide.
So as the global
prevalence of Alzheimer's
and other dementia increases,
there is absolutely a need
for members of the paid dementia
care workforce to increase.
And again, whether we're talking
about those providing care,
or those engaging
in the research,
and the intersection of the two,
this is across the board.
Next slide.
So within the priority,
or within the recommendation,
promoting education
and training,
there's a number
of different components.
And this includes developing,
implementing
and evaluating
training programs,
incentivizing mentorship and
providing research opportunities
and promoting education
of researchers
in recruiting and retaining
research participants
from population that experience
health disparities
in research studies.
So in looking at the first
aspect of this in developing,
implementing and evaluating
training programs.
This just gives you a snapshot
of some of the training programs
and that are really poised
and are addressing
some of these gaps.
But this is only a step
in the right direction
and certainly as we think
about the need to scale up,
there will be a significant need
to increase and expand the scale
and the scope
of these types of initiatives.
Next slide.
And it's really important
to think about
as we look
at the types of training's,
that's it not
a one size fits all.
In fact one of the examples
that I shared the
Global Brain Health Institute,
shared a quote
from one of their mentors.
That I think
the biggest strength
is that mentorship
can be personalized.
Our fellows
are all so different,
they're coming
from unique backgrounds
and experience expertise
and lived experiences.
So as we think about
developing the types
of training
and mentorship programs,
really taking this
into account
that it's not
a one size fits all.
And when we need
to be thinking
about the different types
of landscape
and the different types
of programs and opportunities
that need to come together and
support the growing workforce.
Next slide.
And a big component of this
is the mentorship
and thinking about
incentivizing mentors
and providing
research opportunities
within mixed etiology,
dementia for the current
and emerging generation.
We heard yesterday, I think
one of the discussion items
was the need not only to support
and grow early career
researchers,
but really think about
supporting the network
of researchers
throughout their entire career.
And what you see here
is a listing
of some of the different
ongoing initiatives,
thinking about mentorship,
thinking about
supporting mentors
as well as building
out mentorship programs.
So whether you're looking
at the college age level,
such as the NIH
funded StarU program.
GBHI which I mentioned, you're
looking at the Interdisciplinary
Summer Research Institute.
So this is just a snapshot
of organizations and groups
that are doing some of these
programs and have initiated.
But again, as we think
about the scope and scale
of what is needed
to go forward,
we need to continue
to see these programs grow.
As well as new programs
that get to that
it's not a one size fits all.
Next slide.
And so thinking about
also the idea
of promoting
education of researchers
and recruiting and retaining
diverse research participants.
So throughout this
entire recommendation
we really include activities
that are promoting a conceptual
and theoretical perspective
shaping recruitment.
And retention practices.
And building the necessary tools
and again
you see some
of those tools listed here.
But there are certainly others
that are continuing to be
developed and expanded upon.
And continuing to build
and expand these opportunities.
Next slide.
Such as webinars, workshops,
and other types
of training programs.
And again you see a snapshot
of some of these here.
This is also an opportunity
for funding organizations,
I know Michael J. Fox Foundation
for Parkinson's Research
recently launched and initiated
a large scale program
as one of those examples.
Next slide.
So across this
entire recommendation
you can see the full thing,
the full recommendation
listed here.
There's been a number of work
since the original summit
in 2014
and the continuing summits,
to grow and build out
these educational
and training programs.
But there certainly is an
opportunity to continue to scale
and think about,
it's not a one size fits all
and how do we grow
and expand the opportunities
within mixed etiology dementia?
Next slide.
-Two minutes remaining.
-So thinking about the last
recommendation and again
this all encompassing.
The idea to incentivize
and conduct research
to improve pre and post-data
collection harmonization
and sharing across multiple
etiology cognitive impairment
and dementia studies.
Next slides.
This includes developing and
evaluating common data elements
and standardized
consent language.
And again,
you see a snapshot
of some of these
ongoing initiatives.
Particularly focused on Mac
and the uniform data set,
as well as the CDISK
and the tools that are
growing and expanding.
But, next slide.
It's really important
to think about
how we identify the barriers
and facilitators
to incorporation of these common
data elements and their usage.
So this could include
opportunities to link
and share data overcoming
some of these barriers.
Linking between some of
the different data platforms,
including the common
data elements
and some of
the initiation studies
and I'll show a snapshot
of some of the papers
that have started to do this
in unique ways. Next slide.
And within this recommendation
we also added in promotion
and, promoting the incorporation
of common data elements
into data collection
for observation
and intervention studies.
This is a tremendous opportunity
for funding organizations,
whether it be NIH, or others.
As we look at promoting
and really incentivizing
the incorporation
of these common data elements.
The last component
within this recommendation
is to develop and evaluate
training opportunities
to promote
methodological rigorous
in efficient data sharing.
Next slide.
So across the board again
this is a snapshot
of some of the different
recent papers
that have been published,
that really look at harmonizing
across different longitudinal
studies of cognitive measures.
Looking at some of
the considerations when we,
when we bring together
different types of data.
What are some of the best
practices in data sharing?
If you look at for instance
the Cap Guidelines,
what are some of the initiatives
and platforms such as Gain,
the Critical Path Institute,
and others that
have data available
and that are working
to cross-link
across these different types
of platforms more broadly
and specifically providing
an opportunity to use and to,
and to build upon prior work.
But there's also a really
important component of providing
and developing and evaluating
training opportunities
that promote
the use of this data,
both the sharing of it,
but also the use of it.
And again, that's
a tremendous opportunity
for funding organizations.
So I think in summary,
that brings us
to the multiple etiology
dementia draft recommendations
and I think I'm passing
back to Dr. Possin
to take us
into the discussion. Kate.
-Thank you.
Thank you so much
to all of our speakers today
and now we get to begin
what I hope will be
a really engaging discussion.
We have our first question
in chat from Dale Lestina,
so, Mr. Lestina,
please ask your question.
-Thanks for your patience
while I'm getting myself back
in the tune
with the rest of you folks.
Just a minute.
I got to get my picture.
Well, I'm tapping on it,
but it doesn't come up.
Oh, there I am.
I have a couple recommendations.
I applaud the presentations
of this whole group.
And in your mind's eye
when you look at the video
that we saw
in the beginning,
and you saw the gentleman
with his wife,
she's diagnosed,
there's two parties
involved with this thing.
Now I would recommend
that if in the continuation
of this presentation
is to show for the folks
what is now about
to happen as time goes on
with the woman or the doctor.
When the brain
starts shutting down,
the ability to control bowels,
to control urination,
to control the legs.
That end right there and what
that does to the caregiver
trying to cope with
this situation with a minimum,
if any, understanding
what's going on.
And how to give the patient,
keeping that person comfortable
and as relaxed as possible
because there are periods
of really hallucination
that they know what's going on.
And how that must feel.
Because as you and I all know,
there's no cure for this thing.
That's what's going to happen.
And so I would say Dr. Ochen,
if you were involved with
the continuation of that video
is to track it
a little further
so that the folks
who are doing the research
also can see
what's transpiring,
where the rubber meets
the road of the individuals
who are going through this.
It's extremely important to know
all of the various things
that happen in the brain
that causes the problem.
But then when you're dealing
with the problem,
that's where I think we need
to have more concentration.
And I would say that Kate,
your presentation,
and your colleagues,
you're the same thing,
I very much appreciate
the recognition
of what is involved with this
particular end of the process.
So that's my
first recommendation
is to follow that now,
those videos,
and make that as part
of the presentation as well.
Now my second recommendation
is are any of you familiar
with an organization
called Insight?
I don't see any hands.
Okay.
Insight is located,
well, not too far from NIH.
It's in Northern Virginia.
It's on the west side
of Fairfax City.
And they have -- their executive
director is Anita Irvine.
I-R-W -- I-R-V-I-N.
And what they do
is they treat the person
who has been identified
with dementia,
and the caregiver together.
And they move them
through a process where --
sessions, where the initial
diagnosis of the individual
who has dementia
is dealt with.
They're dealt together,
and then separately.
One of the things that I was
fortunate enough to learn about
Insight is that
for being a caregiver,
they had groups
where they --
support groups,
where they would put me together
with maybe 15 other people
who were going through
the same thing.
And we learned
from one another.
"Oh, you dealt
with it this way."
And, "Oh, that's --
I got to give that a try."
That kind of thing.
And you have a support group
that after your spouse dies,
continues on.
And I think that if you would
look into that, if you want,
I can give you
her contact information,
and explore what they're doing.
It's at least something
to look at together.
And when you're looking
at expanding things,
they don't want
to expand too fast
because they want
to keep doing a good job.
And they're just now
beginning their second office
that they're about to expand to.
So thank you for your attention
and listening to
what I would recommend,
and having been a fellow
who's gone through it
from a caregiver's
point of view.
I appreciate
your kind attention. Thank you.
-Thank you, Mr. Lastina.
Your comments are really
important to our committee,
and we will definitely make note
of both of
these recommendations.
And I personally will into
the Insight program as well.
So thank you for
those recommendations.
-Thank you.
-So let's see,
next I believe is Penny Dacks.
-Thank you, Dr. Christine.
I actually want to defer
to Ian first
because I think
he had his name in first.
So --
-Okay. Let's do that.
Ian Kremer?
-Hi there, everyone.
Penny, thank you.
Very kind of you.
Hi, everyone. I'm Ian Kremer.
I'm executive director
of the LEAD Coalition.
We're a coalition
of 100-member organization,
so about another
100 allied organizations
doing Alzheimer's and related
dementias advocacy at the level.
I have a couple
of recommendations.
I just want to preface it
by saying
that I've had
the pleasure of serving
on the steering committee
for NIH's two Dementia Care
and Services Research Summits.
In those summits, we did not,
for a variety of reasons
that I probably shouldn't
get into today,
we didn't have bandwidth to get
into detection and diagnosis
in the level of depth
that we all would have liked to.
And that so that's still
on our agenda
for subsequent care
and services research summits,
but I'm delighted
that you have taken time today
on your agenda
to dive into this.
And I want to commend you all
for remarkably
strong presentations
that get at the heart of much
of what makes detection
and diagnosis so challenging.
Nobody can be comprehensive
about that in any one session,
but you've all done
a remarkable job.
So that's the context
for what will follow,
which is maybe
a recommendation or two.
I think there are opportunities
for collaborative
funding agreements
between NINDS, and NIA,
particularly BSR at NIA,
around the psychological aspects
necessary to support effective
detection and diagnosis.
And to walk you through that
as briefly as I can,
I'll just make a few points.
I've advocated
for about a decade work
for an informal framework,
a framework that I informally
called TACA, T-A-C-A.
And that is that
the detection and diagnosis
should be timely, accurate,
compassionate, and actionable.
T-A-C-A.
I think you all today
have addressed
remarkably well the need
for detection and diagnosis
to be timely, accurate,
and actionable.
And there have been
some allusions to,
but maybe less direct reference
to the compassionate
or empathetic part
of this process.
But I think it's really
key and pivotal
to the efficacy
of detection and diagnosis,
and so it's an opportunity
for research investments
by an NIA,
NINDS,
and maybe sister
institutes across the NIH,
and certainly
private funders as well.
And I'll flesh it out
in the way.
So you made reference,
for instance,
to diagnose and adiós problem
that is endemic in the field,
and we all know
that that plays a role
in when it happens
at the detection stage
where there is identification
of possible cognitive impairment
and referral to a specialist
for a formal diagnosis
that often families,
individual patients,
do not proceed
to that specialist.
And part of the reason for that
is health system infrastructure,
but part is also
the psychological impact
of a poorly-conveyed
detection outcome.
So if the news is given
in a way that is unhelpful,
unempathetic,
lacking compassion,
it makes it that much harder
psychologically for people,
for patients and their families
to take the next step
and go to the specialist
for confirmation or refutation
of what detection set might
turn into a diagnosis
of cognitive impairment.
This is fundamentally
devastating news for most people
that know anything
about Alzheimer's disease
or any other form
of dementia,
or they just know
the umbrella term "dementia".
So if this is bad news
is not given well,
it interferes
with the likelihood
that someone will then pursue
the specialist confirmation
or refutation
of what detection indicated
might be
at a forthcoming diagnosis.
So I think it has
to be done better.
It can be done better.
We know clinicians
to do it beautifully.
We have to figure out
how they do it beautifully,
why they do it beautifully,
and how to replicate in scale
that compassionate element
of an otherwise professional
detection and diagnosis process.
And I would say the same
at the diagnosis
process by the specialist.
All the good recommendations
about making it actionable,
referral to community services,
getting one's legal, medical,
and other affairs
in order, etc.,
that all goes out the window
if patients
and families
emotionally shut down
because the news was not given
in a way that was supportive.
So we can do it
a little research figure out
how to do it well.
And then two last points.
I apologize for taking
so much time.
We have to be thoughtful
about the psychological
burden on providers,
on healthcare providers
themselves.
It is traumatizing
to give bad news for a living.
It can be a little
less traumatizing
if you have tools
and resources
to give to patients
and their families,
but there is still
the potential,
and I think the likelihood
for some accumulation
of psychological,
negative psychological
impact on providers.
And to the point
that Heather drew out,
I thought really beautifully
in her presentation,
all the workforce challenges
that we've got
are that much more vulnerable
to becoming worse
if we don't look
after the well-being,
the psychological well-being
of the providers themselves.
So if we're going to get
five-fold increase in the field,
but have people
fall out of the field
because of the psychological
burdens that we don't attend to,
we'll never get there.
And then the last thing,
and again I won't belabor
the point
because you all have correctly
and beautifully
identified health equity
as a crosscutting core
element of the work,
but all of the research
about how to passionately,
psychologically,
appropriately convey and
conduct detection and diagnosis,
that all has to be tailored
in a culturally-appropriate way.
One-size-fits-all is going to be
a recipe for failure
both for physicians
and their ancillary staff,
as well as for patients,
human beings,
and their ancillary care
and support teams.
So I'll end there.
Thank you again
for your indulgence of time.
-Thank you.
I took careful note
of these really insightful
and important recommendations
about compassionate disclosure,
culturally-appropriate
disclosure,
and considering the burdens
on providers.
I agree these need to be
highlighted more
in our recommendations,
so we'll bring us
back to our committee
and review those together.
Thank you.
So moving onto Penny Dax.
-Thank you.
Penny Dacks with the Association
for Frontotemporal Degeneration.
I just wanted to offer
a couple quick comments.
I really applaud the incredible
work your group has done.
And in the interest of time,
I am not suggesting necessarily
response to my comments
but just something
to reflect on
that we've heard so much
throughout the whole meeting
as we should about
the need for inclusivity
in how we design
our research.
And at the same time,
we heard about the need
for more widespread detection
of cognitive impairment
to detect it earlier.
And there was a rich discussion
of some of the benefits
and risks as it relates,
say, to the quality of life
and psychological well-being.
I think there's a lot
across those two topics
that I know I have
a lot to learn about,
and I think the field needs
to make sure we're very careful
about with how do people
from different socioeconomic,
geographic, and racial,
and ethnic backgrounds differ
in their perception
of screening for dementia.
Not just in
how they'll receive it,
but what do they
actually want.
How are they going
to respond to it?
And very importantly, how did
their risks and benefits differ?
So for example,
if cognitive impairment
gets detected in the clinic
before families even suspected
that this is on the horizon,
it maybe blocks some
long-term care insurance.
You know, has the insurance that
we've already gotten to show
that certain groups are
at higher risk of dementia,
has that already translated
into higher insurance
premiums for individuals?
I think there's just so much
we have to understand
as we focus on developing
preventative therapies
to understand
how these things are translating
into financial ramifications
because the insurance groups
and all of their technologies
and all of their policies
might be taking our research
and using it in ways
that we may not be anticipating.
I think we need policy research
to understand
how our advances are affecting
the most vulnerable
in our communities at that
financial and policy level,
and how it's affecting
employment risk,
insurance risks.
And I just wanted
to also emphasize
that some of the pragmatic
intervention research
that Dr. Okonkwo
really eloquently framed
I think it's also
really foundational
and important to communicate
when we're asking these groups
to participate in research
to help them understand
that value is to them
and their communities is first
and foremost in everybody's mind
as we ask them
to participate in research.
And I thank you again
for all of your time.
-Thank you. Well put, Penny.
I think these are important
points that we can incorporate
perhaps into our
recommendation too.
If there's no comment
from the panel,
we'll just take note of this
and bring it back
for discussion to our group.
I agree with these points.
Sorry, Penny, one more thing?
-I'm so sorry.
I just also forgot to say that
for those that are early
detection of dementia
and early onset dementia,
that's when people
are the most reliant
on their income
and their employment.
And I think that's where we need
to pay really careful attention.
-Thank you.
So in the interest of time,
I think will move on
to the next question,
which I believe was Dezheap?
Let's see. I don't have
the full name here, but.
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay. Great.
Please introduce yourself
and ask your --
or offer your point.
-Okay. So I'm Dezarell.
I'm a professor in
the University of Minnesota.
So I have a question.
So I studied cell biology
and the also animal model.
So all, like, [Indistinct]
nuclei, beta, mechanic injury,
infection, all affect how.
So POW is a common
downstream mechanism.
And my question is what
proportion of dementia patients,
have a POW pathology?
Can anyone answer that?
Maybe we should --
and I don't want to --
maybe we should increase
the research effort on POW
because it started
coming downstream pocket
for so many multiple
newly-degenerative disease.
I will stop here. Thank you.
-Dazerell, thank you very much.
This is Dr. Lea Grinberg.
I'm a neuropathologist at UCSF,
and it's a pleasure
trying to answer this question
with the best
of my knowledge.
Thank you very much
for your question.
I think for a neuropathologist
and many others in the field,
this is a quite important
question that we face every day.
Actually one of the
recommendations for this group
is to try to promote
even better mapping studies
especially using
human neuropathology
to understand
these questions.
And this is based
on the amazing results
that we got from a recent
clinical pathological cohort
and how much we learned
from this.
So a simple answer
to your question
is that most of the patients
that have dementia
and come to autopsy,
they have multiple pathologies,
and pathologies that
involve POW is one of them.
In neuropathological studies,
we have the ability
to try to classify
these neuropathies.
And in most cases, we see POW
that is related
to Alzheimer's disease
neuropathological changes.
When it comes from amyloid,
we call this
Alzheimer's disease.
When it doesn't
come with amyloid,
we might call this Scart.
Some call early
Alzheimer disease stages.
We have POW that deposits
in glial cells and astroglia,
what we call rTag that
it's very common during aging.
And in populations over 80,
we might find it in
at least 50% of the cases.
And it's the same for a change
that call agraphiac
brain disease
that the field doesn't know
exactly what it does,
if it's a foe
or if it's a friend.
Now to answer the question
in another way,
when we look at patients
that the primary
neuropathological diagnosis
is not related to POW,
for instance, Lewy body disease,
or to TDP 43 protein properties,
it's still just a minority.
We won't have any kind of
POW deposits,
especially of the AD-type.
So thank you for a question.
It's something that certainly
this group thinks
we have to pursue,
especially in diverse population
because most of
our understanding
comes from Caucasians.
Thank you very much.
-Thank you, Dr. Grinberg.
We have just
a couple more minutes.
We're cutting into the break
for those of you
who are still with us.
Let's try to get
some brief comments
if possible from Constantino,
and then Helen Metzger,
and then we'll take a break.
So Constantino?
-Hi. Thank you.
It was wonderful overview.
So you know, by listening
to vascular dementia,
you know, lectures, the series
of contributions yesterday,
it seems to me
there is a lot overlap
between
what was discussed today
and what was
discussed yesterday.
Particularly at the level
of the basic science
because vascular components
is going to be one of
the most common. All right?
So I would urge you to kind of
harmonize better the multiple,
the, you know, cause of dementia
with the vascular component
because that's going to have
an impact on the diagnoses
and impact on the prevention.
Because as far as I can tell,
that may be the strongest,
you know, tool we have in terms
of overall dementia.
But there finger studies,
and you know,
the mind screen and so on.
And so that would be
very important.
Also at the level
of care delivery,
for example,
cardiologists, you know,
may not know as much about,
you know, about how to deal
with the vascular conditions
in the brain
so there is a better
need for harmonization
also at that level.
So that's just a plea
for a perhaps more harmonization
with the vascular
dementia aspects.
-Thank you for
that important point.
If there's no comments
from the panel,
we will absolutely
review carefully
the VCID recommendations
in ours
and look for areas
of harmonization.
I really appreciate
that comment.
So in closing, our last comment
will be from Helen Metzger.
-Hi, Kate.
I'd like to thank the committee
for what I've heard
this morning.
I want to reinforce,
Dale had a lot to contribute,
but Ian, what you and Penny
brought to the floor
has said a lot to me.
I've been in this for 30 years
with Lewy body dementia.
Kate knows me well.
I've been part of
the care ecosystem
and part of the committee
that helped develop
the Care Ecosystem.
I'm also involved
in the PPV/PPI committee
at the Global Brain
Health Institute,
and been working with them
for over a year
on making certain that
the voices of those people
affected with these diseases
are at the table.
So I just want
to remind the committee
because I didn't
see it directly,
you know,
touched upon this morning,
is that the voices,
the care partners
and those living with disease
have to be brought forth
and need to be integrated
from the area
all the way from conceptive
research to execution,
to outcomes
and implementation.
So that is, that's all I want
to say this morning,
but thank you for all
of your amazing work.
I sincerely appreciate it.
And we'll bring it
to those people
that I work with
in the trenches.
-Thank you, Helen for your
participation and your advocacy.
You are continuing
to make a huge difference,
and we will take
that point back
and find a way to weave it
into our recommendations
so it is explicit.
Thank you, and thank you
everyone on the panel,
and everyone
for your participation
as we shift now to the break.
-We're ready to start
the next session.
I'm pleased to introduce
Dr. Kristen Dams-O'Connor
as the scientific chair
of the Traumatic Brain Injury
in Alzheimer's Disease
and Alzheimer's Disease-related
Dementias session.
Kristen?
-Thank you. Next slide.
Okay. Let's get started.
Next slide.
Our speakers
have no disclosures.
Next slide.
I am very grateful
and would like to thank
the subcommittee members
who shared their expertise,
and the NIH program staff
who supported our work.
It has been a privilege to work
with this awesome group.
Next slide.
This session on post-TDI,
AD/ADRD base was first included
in the ADR Base Summit
in 2019 as an emerging topic.
And we're now very well-placed
in the multiple ideology
of dementias session.
We've heard throughout
the last day
and a half about the importance
of considering life
course exposures.
TBI is one of many life
course exposures
associated with dementia risk.
And one thing
that is unique about TBI
is that it's an exposure
with a time zero,
a clear point from which
we can investigate the pathways
through which it may influence
the proliferation
of distinct
pathological processes.
This knowledge may open doors
for understanding
the pathogenesis of dementias
of multiple ideologies.
Next slide. I'll start
was just quick definitions.
A traumatic brain injury
is a blow or jolt to the head
or neck that result in a loss
or alteration of consciousness.
The pyramid on the right
illustrates the CDC's estimate
that almost three million
Americans need care
in the emergency department
for TBI each year.
Next slide.
TBI can result
in a range of symptoms.
In general, we expect
that most people
with an uncomplicated mild TBI,
which is sometimes
called a concussion,
to recover completely
within days or weeks.
Next slide.
However, those with more
severe injuries
may experience more
severe consequences,
including lifelong
disability or death.
The estimates you see here
are based on data
collected through
the NIDILRR-funded
TBI Model Systems
National Data.
And as you can see
about one in five have died
within five years of injury.
Thirty % experienced
deterioration and function
between one and five years,
and the remaining survivors
either remain
functionally-stable or improved.
Next slide.
But how does this observed
decline relate to dementia?
For years,
we have been taught that
TBI is one of the strongest
environmental risk factors
for Alzheimer's disease.
But as this area
of study has matured,
we have learned that the reality
is far more complex.
Results vary across studies
that differ tremendously
in their methodology,
their sampling strategies
and their definitions
of TBI and dementia.
In general though, we do see
that more severe injury
tends to be associated
with greater dementia risk,
and TBI is a well-recognized
and potentially modifiable
risk factor for dementia.
Next slide.
Although a global pandemic
began just months
after releasing our 2019
research recommendations,
substantial progress
has been made.
Next slide.
First, we have --
oh, next slide.
First we have an updated
consensus definition
for the post-mortem
diagnosis CTE neuropathology.
CTE is believed to be related to
repetitive head trauma exposure
and revised criteria provide
a more precise definition
of the pathognomonic lesion.
We also now have a preliminary
consensus definition
for research
diagnosis of traumatic
encephalopathy syndrome,
which is the proposed clinical
correlate of CTE neuropathology.
This represents
an important first step
towards in vivo diagnosis.
Our colleagues at BU have begun
the hard work of validating
in vivo criteria for TES,
and these are the types
of studies
that will pave the way
for further refinements.
Major questions remain though
about the minimum thresholds
for CTE diagnosis,
the role of the isolated
traumatic brain injury
in CTE and NTES,
and the relationships
between these pathologies
and clinical symptoms
with other ADRDs.
Next slide.
-Two minutes remaining.
-One major initiative
that has resulted since 2019
is that Connect TBI Study led by
Doug Smith and Willie Stewart,
and 13 institutions
also represented.
This project will evaluate
brain tissue
from cases
with traumatic brain injury
and creative brain repository
for tissue sharing.
Next.
We also have a large initiative
led Ann McKee
at Boston University
that will leverage
existing brain banks to --
that have very
well-characterized
and fully-harmonized clinical
and head trauma
exposure histories
to characterized pathologies
related to repetitive
traumatic brain injury
and head trauma,
and their clinical phenotypes.
Next slide.
We've also been able to expand
the late effects of TBI Project,
which is a perspective
brain donor program
with autopsy endpoints,
and this will allow us to expand
to our community recruitment
and longitudinal follow-up.
Next slide.
Okay.
So our subcommittee's first
recommendation reflects the fact
that this is a relatively
new area of investigation.
And we really feel that we can
learn from our colleagues
who have been studying
dementia for decades.
We identify
really important opportunities
for interdisciplinary crosstalk
and expanding collaboration
across traditionally
siloed areas of study.
Next slide.
For starters, we hope to convene
a working group of stakeholders
in the TBI and multiple
ideology dementia communities
to evaluate the extent to which
current knowledge in ADRD
can the applied to the study
of dementia after TBI,
and also how our understanding
of the acute
and chronic
pathophysiology of TBI
can contribute to
our understanding of ADRDs.
Again, since TBI is a risk
factor with a time zero,
we believe that further study
will benefit
the entire ADRD community.
I also say, and this is a figure
you've seen before,
is when we recalculate
the population
attributable factor of dementia
risk using population
representative data
on TBI prevalence,
we see that the number
of dementia cases
that may be at least
partially attributable to TBI
is actually perhaps
much greater.
Next slide.
Another component
of our first recommendation
is to harmonize
existing data
across longitudinal TBI
and ADRD studies.
Here we illustrate one example
of an effort along these lines
to pull data from five studies
of cognitive aging.
So we have newly collected
very detailed characterization
of lifetime TBI exposure,
which will allow us to examine
late life implications of TBI.
And we're using IRT-based
methods to co-calibrate data
that were gathered
from different measures
of the same constructs,
such as cognition and mood.
Efforts like this can allow us
to conduct
more granular investigation
into the intersecting factors
that influence risk for ADRD
well beyond what would be
possible in a single study.
Next slide.
Ideally, future efforts
will maximize measurement
harmonization from the start
by prospectively collecting
multimodal common data elements
to facilitate comparisons
and data sharing.
The ENIGMA
Brain Injury Initiative
is one example of a global
working group with these goals.
Next slide.
Post-mortem
TBI common data elements,
which is actually another area
of progress since 2019,
provide a road map
for prospective collection
of harmonized data.
Our hope is that existing
brain banks
will use these common
neuropathological methods
and post-mortem
family interview methods
to characterize post-TBI ADRD
and facilitate data
sharing and cross study
comparisons.
Next slide.
The Olympic Sensi studies
provide another great roadmap
for neural imaging,
harmonization in particular.
So they aligned with ADME
from the start
by maximizing overlap of both
clinical and imaging metrics.
For example,
they used a unique phantom
that has an isotropic
diffusion capabilities
with hollow fibers
the size of axons
to mimic
the diffusion properties
of diffused axonal injury
and other tissue
properties of relevance
to both traumatic brain injury
and neurodegenerative disease.
Next slide.
Our committee believes
that neuroinformatics
will play
an important role as well.
So our first recommendation
will require modern cloud-based
informatics and analytics
harmonization platforms
for QA,
post-processing,
and harmonizing data
across sites,
and scanners,
and software.
Historically, we have had
to sometimes sacrifice precision
for generalizability
successfully harmonizing
only relatively crude metrics
across major scanner vendors
and software platforms.
But modern informatics platforms
can automate
many aspects of this,
which again is necessary
for multi-site studies. Next.
Recent examples of
an international collaboration
that required harmonization
across continents
is seen on the track TBI
and center TBI studies.
And again, this may be
a great future opportunity.
Next slide.
The final component
of recommendation one
is the need
to encourage collaboration
between clinical researchers,
biostatisticians,
epidemiologists,
and data scientists
to incorporate
multi-dimensional,
multimodal data,
and employ more sophisticated
causal inference methodologies,
and work with
implementation scientists
to maximize the clinical
translatability of this work.
This is inherently
interdisciplinary,
and collaboration is required
to move the science forward.
Next slide.
Our second recommendation
pertains to clinical phenotyping
across exposure histories
to pave the way for
in vivo diagnostics.
Next slide.
First, we need to establish
and validate
a quantitative index of lifetime
head trauma exposure.
One thing we have learned
is that administrative data
only identifies those who have
sought and received care.
So self-report is considered
the gold standard
for lifetime TBI exposure.
We consistently find
that structured questionnaires
that use contextual cueing
for lifetime injury reporting,
such as the Ohio
State University
TBI identification method,
or the brain injury
screening questionnaire,
are really required
for comprehensive
exposure ascertainment.
So this notion
that all important TBIs
are in the medical record
is simply untrue.
Our colleagues
have actually found
that those who never
sought care
have worse long-term
outcomes after injury.
So this not seeking care may
actually be an important proxy
for other factors that matter
a lot in long-term outcomes.
The last thing
I'll say about this
is in the upper
righthand corner there,
you see that single TBI
rarely exists in isolation
so you see their data
from a moderate severe TBI study
that shows that about
half of the sample
with a single TBI
also have repetitive head injury
in the context of sports,
or military service,
or intimate partner violence.
Many also had multiple
isolated TBIs.
So the question of how
to quantify lifetime exposure
in a way that reflects
clinical reality
will be foundational
to this area of study.
Next slide.
Similarly crucial
is the need to establish
and validate
a provisional definition,
a clinical definition
of post-TBI dementias
that distinguishes
chronic effects of TBI
from a progressive
neurodegenerative disease.
So because the term "dementia"
is broad
and has multiple
clinical definitions,
it has sometimes been used
to characterize
the acute effects of TBI
or the stable
chronic effects of TBI.
And so a definition
such as what you see here,
wherein post-TBI ADRD is defined
as post-recovery decline
really requires further study
and validation. Next.
Out committee felt
that longitudinal studies
are especially essential
to recommendation two,
which is to characterize
the clinical phenotype
and the phenotypic heterogeneity
and clinical course,
the protective factors
and the effect modifiers
of post-TBI ADRDs.
It may be especially informative
to study people prospectively
from the time of injury
to understand
the primary pathology,
the secondary injury
processes,
and the long-term outcomes
as they evolve over time.
The TBI model systems,
for example the track TBI Study
and Evolve Study
are three examples
of these prospective studies
with complementary strengths.
So the Evolve Study,
for example,
led by Christine McDonald
follows active duty
military service members
from the battlefield
and is now approaching
a 10-year follow-up.
And this has uncovered
a pattern suggesting evolution
as opposed to a resolution
of symptoms over time.
The TBI model system
is the largest prospective
TBI outcome study
in the world.
But with telephone
data collection,
it doesn't currently
include biological markers.
So we have
a tremendous opportunity
to learn from these
types of studies.
Next slide.
We currently do not know
how post-TBI ADRD
relates to other ADRDs.
The studies illustrated here
suggests that older adults
with TBI
have more motor impairment
and more pronounced
neurobehavioral symptoms
relative to those
with Alzheimer's disease
in particular.
And on the right, you see
that compared to older adults
without TBI,
their cognitive profiles
suggest more difficulty
with executive
functioning
and processing speed,
which are hallmark
characteristics of TBI,
but not characteristic
of AD-type dementia.
Next slide.
Phenotyping a heterogenous
multi-ideology disease
process is no small task,
and efforts to-date
were recently summarized
in this brain trauma
blueprint paper
that was just
published last year.
These studies do suggest
that clinically-distinguishable
subtypes exist.
And on the right, we see
evidence of a TBI phenotype
that overlaps with clinical
correlates of AD and FTD
in a sample
of post-9/11 veterans
with early onset dementia.
Next slide.
Central to recommendation two
is the need to develop
and validate
post-TBI ADRD biomarkers
to non-invasively
identify progressive pathologies
and to monitor clinical
disease progression over time.
The radiology biomarkers
at the top
are used for more acute
TBI studies
that can inform studies
of the evolution of TBI
in the transition
to recovery or to decline.
Like other dementias, TBI is not
a single disease process
with the unified path
of physiological mechanisms.
So characterizing the acute
and chronic changes
ideally in longitudinal studies
will be highly informative.
Although substantial progress
has been made in acute
diagnostic
and prognostic markers for TBI,
there has been relatively
little investigation
into biomarkers of
posttraumatic neurodegeneration.
The top candidates
though are those
that can detect traumatic
and neuroinflammatory injury,
and that can also
detect the onset
and progression of
neurodegenerative diseases.
As you can see in the figure
on the right,
our colleague studying
Alzheimer's disease
has found
excellent correspondence
between blood
CSF and PET markers.
And this appears
to provide information
on disease progression
of pathologies
that are also known to be
implicated in post-TBI ADRD.
So these candidate markers
really require further study
in the chronic stages
following TBI.
Finally, the need to recruit
diverse samples
warrants
particular mention here.
This includes men
and women with repetitive,
or isolated, or very diverse
injury exposure histories.
It includes
underrepresented minorities.
It includes, again, a range
of head trauma exposures,
mechanisms, and chronicity.
And it includes --
it requires clinic
and community-based
recruitment.
Our colleagues who have been
studying dementia for decades
have demonstrated
that those who are recruited
in the community differ
in important ways from those
who are recruited
from clinic-based settings.
And we expect those differences
to, if anything,
to be more pronounced
in the study of post-TBI
ADRD given the high rates of TBI
in homeless shelters,
substance use disorder
treatment settings, prisons,
and among multiply
marginalized populations.
So we need to ensure
that studies of post-TBI
AD and ADRD include
representative samples
of individuals living with TBI.
With that, next slide,
I will pass the microphone
to Dr. Dirk Keene
from the University
of Washington
who will discuss
recommendation three.
-Thanks, Kristin. Next slide.
Great. Next slide.
So these are the --
so recommendation three
is really a bridge
from the first
two recommendations
to the fourth
recommendation.
This is the recommendation
listed out
into the sub recommendations.
But if you go to the next slide,
I've tried to summarize
to capture the, you know,
the recommendations
by its essence.
And really what recommendation
three is about
is supporting and building
research infrastructure
to make sure that we
take advantage of the,
of what's come before us
especially with AD
and other ADRD research
to understand
and bridge what we know about AD
and ADRD for TBI-related ADRD.
And so we need to study
representative cohort.
That can't be
emphasized enough.
At every step,
we need to be studying
the breadth of TBI exposure
from ethnic and socioeconomic,
and other backgrounds.
We need to studying
the representative samples.
We need to build and enhance
our biorepositories,
that's from a brain
biorepositories,
biofluid biorepositories,
and then develop
standardized approaches.
So in the next few slides,
I'll go over each of these
in a little bit more depth.
Next.
So the Alzheimer's Disease
Research Centers have --
it's a really robust
multi-center network
that's been --
that was established by NIA
over 30 years ago.
On the right,
you can see that states
that have one or more centers.
The light blue ones
are the exploratory centers.
This program
continues to build.
And each center has really
robust infrastructure
developed
along the lines of cores
that have led the way
in helping us understand
how to develop
prospective studies
and these multimodal approaches
to study disease
from even
pre-symptomatic levels
all the way through
to brain donation
and neuropathological studies.
And so I think TBI ADRD
can really learn
from what's been done
in Alzheimer's disease
and Parkinson's disease,
these established networks.
And I think
the Alzheimer Center Network
is a prime example
of how AD can leverage
that infrastructure
and that expertise.
And then also
there's other resources
that have been built up
around other focuses,
other areas of study.
The National Alzheimer's
Coordinating Center
is a centralized data repository
for the Alzheimer's Centers
and Alzheimer's Disease Research
Participant Data.
The National Centralized
Repository for AD,
and Related Dementias NCRAD
is really leading the way
along with other centers
on biospecimen storage
sharing and characterization.
And then there's
a multitude of other
really well-established
studies in ADRD
that I think TBI research
can leverage and build upon
so that we're not
reinventing the wheel,
so that we're taking advantage
of the incredible investment
that's been made and it's
being made for TBI-related ADRD.
Next slide. It's really critical
to study representative cohorts,
and to study those
cohorts prospectively.
And so I've listed some
community-based cohorts there.
There's many others.
But the idea is that
you need to start,
you need to start at
the very beginning with cohorts
that you can characterize
clinically, with biomarkers,
all the way through as the --
as TBI-related ADRD
and other diseases advance.
And so these community-based
cohorts are really critical
in representing the diversity of
traumatic brain injury exposure,
the diversity of the population
that we're studying
so that we have inclusion
and can understand differences
and similarities
across the population.
And then what I think
is really important
is to take
TBI-related expertise
and build that into existing
and prospective ADRD studies.
And the same
goes for TBI studies
to really leverage what we know
and what we've learned
through ADRD,
through our Alzheimer's center
and other centers
to build that
into our TBI-related studies
so that we're talking
the same language
across these different cohorts.
Next.
Kristen mentioned
Delayed Effects
of Traumatic Brain
Injury study.
It's a prime example, I think,
of a multimodal approach
from the time a person enrolls
all the way through
to the time a person dies,
if that's the case.
And collecting as much data
along the way
so that we can relate
the different biofluid,
and cognitive, and other
biomarkers to exposure history.
And also moving forward
to neuroimaging
and also neuropathology markers
so that we can link the data
from one aspect of a study
participant all the way back.
So that we can understand
during life what underlies
the kinds of cognitive deficits
or behavioral abnormalities
that are happening in people
that have suffered a TBI.
And how does that relate to
neurodegenerative disease. Next.
We need to build and enhance
brain bio repositories.
Again, this is
the Connect TBI group,
which is, I think,
one very good example,
along with the BU group,
of how to leverage existing
brain bio repositories
with a focus on
TBI-related neurodegeneration.
Bringing resources together
that previously
hadn't been brought together
to try to understand
what the relationship
between TBI exposure
and neurodegeneration is.
There's a number of different
other --
there's a lot of
infrastructure out there
that we can use
to build this together.
And ultimately use
that experience to --
into prospective cohort
studies where we can tailor
our characterization of folks
all the way through.
Using the TBI
and ADRD-related assessments
from the time
a person enters a study,
all the way through
their different neuroimaging
and other biomarker studies,
through the end of the study.
Next.
And so we need to enhance
brain bio repositories.
I use the Brain Initiative
here as an example.
The Brain Initiative
is really leading the way.
It's a major effort from NIH
to understand the structure,
and connectivity, and function
of the normal brain.
They have pioneered
new methodologies
to study human brain tissue
and those efforts I think
we need to work from
and learn from those efforts
when we study ADRD,
and specifically
TBI-related ADRD.
So that we're maximizing
the investment of the NIH
and other stakeholders
in this research.
And doing everything we can
for every person that donates
their brain to learn as much
as we can from their brain.
And I think this is one example.
Many of
the different brain banks
are pioneering
new methodologies.
And to the extent that we can
learn as much as possible
from each one of these samples
by studying cohort people
who have been studied
all the way during life
with well-known exposures.
And then maximizing
the technological approaches
that we have to understanding
the different pathways
to injury and dementia
is really important.
Next slide.
And then to establish
and implement
standards for neuropathology.
Kristen mentioned the CDBs.
It's really exciting the way
this has developed.
So on the left, in 2012,
the National Institute on Aging
and its Alzheimer's Association
guidelines
for the pathological
assessment of AD were published.
And those really sent
the standard
for how neuropathologists talk
to each other about what the --
what each brain
that they're studying shows.
The NINDS and NIBIB
consensus meetings,
both the first
and second for CTE,
really built on this in the fact
that we took
those recommendations
for AD and ADRD neuropath.
And built on those for the CTE
consensus recommendation
so that we can refer back
to brain biorepositories
even 20,
30 years ago
with similar sampling
processes and assessments.
To sort of leverage that so that
we're understanding TBI
in the context of
neurodegenerative disease.
And then, finally, thanks
to a great group of people,
the accommodated elements
for neuropathology
that Kristen mentions
are essentially done
and ready
for people to start using.
So we really need,
as a community,
to be hopefully implementing
and using these recommendations
so that, again,
we can talk to each other.
So that the Alzheimer's
Disease researcher
can talk to the TBI researcher
and we're all using
the same language.
Importantly, in the CDEs,
I just want to highlight,
we intentionally built
in the possibility, too,
for flexibility, so that
there's a common baseline.
But it opens up the --
it encourages different
biorepositories to study areas
that they have expertise in,
areas that may contribute
down the road
to new approaches to this.
Which I think is really
exciting for these CDEs.
Next slide.
-Two minutes remaining.
-Got you. Whoops.
So the last thing is to leverage
and build infrastructure
to promote tissue
and data sharing.
So this slide is just
highlighting what we can do
once a person
has donated their brain.
We can perform ex vivo
neuroimaging,
extensive sampling.
We have the ability
in many groups
are imaging
and scanning microscope slides
and there are multiple
different repositories
available to share
this information.
We need to really promote
the ability for each of us
to see what each other is doing
so that we can learn
from each other
and maximize the investment
of the donors
and the stakeholders.
Next slide.
So this is just highlighting
the really critical relevance
of human brain donation
and human research
in helping us to eventually
establish mechanism,
and that's a mouse brain
on the bottom.
And so what we can learn
from human brain
is what's relevant
to the disease or the impairment
and we can generate hypotheses.
But the only way we can
go test those hypotheses,
and establish mechanism, and
ultimately develop treatments
to test in back in people is
with these experimental systems.
Next slide.
And so human neuropathology
and these --
and from really well-studied
and representative diverse
cohorts is just essential.
And neuropathology
can provide a bridge
from those outstanding
representative cohort --
prospective cohort studies.
Ultimately to where we can
understand mechanisms
and develop treatments.
And so with that,
I'm going to hand it off
to Dr. Vicky Johnson from
the University of Pennsylvania.
-Thanks, Dirk.
Hi, everyone,
and thank you,
also, to the organizers.
It's a pleasure to be here
and participate in this summit.
Next slide, please.
So first, I don't have
any disclosures,
and I'm going to talk about
recommendation for Priority 4.
Which is to promote
the basic translational research
to elucidate the mechanistic
pathways, development,
and progression of post-TBI
AD/ADRD neuropathologies.
And their associations
with clinical symptoms.
Next slide, please.
So I'm just going to start
with a little bit
of background about TBI.
And some of
the important considerations
that are going to be
necessary in understanding
how TBI might ultimately
lead to neurodegeneration.
So TBI is caused by
some mechanical event
resulting in trauma
to the brain.
We often talk about it like
it's one disease, one disorder,
but in reality,
the acute pathologies of TBI
are really very diverse
and complex.
And you can see here some
examples of different CT scans,
all with displaying very
different types of injuries.
But importantly, all falling
into that category
of severe TBI.
There's also a spectrum
of severity.
We've heard about
repetitive mild TBI
as a risk factor
for later neurodegeneration.
And the pathophysiology of
or what's happening in the brain
in mild TBI even acutely
and even following very
low-level repetitive exposures
is something that's far
less-well understood.
So in summation,
TBI is really heterogeneous
with a wide spectrum in both the
nature and severity of injury.
Next slide, please.
So what we do know,
at least in the more
severe forms of injury,
is that there are
evolving pathologies
over a temporal course.
There are the acute
primary pathologies
directly related
to the mechanical injury.
For example, this might be
direct perturbation
of the vasculature
resulting in hemorrhage
or direct injury to neurons
and axons causing things
like traumatic axonal injury.
And what we know
is that this can lead
to really very complex and
diverse secondary pathologies.
And these some of which
are listed here of being studied
over many years both clinically
and experimentally.
And what we've come
to appreciate
is that some of these
secondary processes
can occur over many weeks
and really quite protracted
periods of time post-injury.
And then, of course, what we're
interested in here today
is that some of these
individuals, certainly not all,
who have chronic pathologies,
including those which are --
encompass AD and ADRD-associated
pathologies.
And I think important
to remember
over that same time frame,
there may very well be processes
of recovery or reorganization
that are also occurring in
the brain in response to injury.
And critically,
and as Kristen mentioned,
is perhaps what's
a little bit different
from other neurodegenerative
disease,
at least in the case
of more severe injuries.
Is that we have a clear start
point or time zero essentially
when we know that
this specific event has occurred
and I put an individual
on a pathway towards
delayed neurodegeneration.
What we don't really have
a great understanding of
is if and how this relates
to the nature, extent,
and evolution of these
earlier pathologies.
Next slide. So with respect
to the neuropathology,
there's been a lot of focus
on type pathologies,
but I think
it's important to note
that through various different
cohorts, K series, descriptions.
And some individuals
fall into the eye
of various other pathologies
have been described.
Including amyloid-beta,
TDP 43 proteinopathies,
vascular pathologies,
chronic inflammatory processes,
axonal degeneration, axonal and
atrophic processes in the brain.
And a big question around this
is what we refer
to as the clinical
pathological correlation.
So what aspects
of these pathologies
are important contributors
to the clinical symptoms
and clinical progression
that Kristen has
so nicely described?
And what do these pathologies
potentially interact
in some way?
And another important question
is whether
and in what way
these various pathologies
relate to the number,
severity, and types of TBI.
And perhaps other factors
such as age at injury.
So there has been some progress
in this regard
and examining
these various questions.
And as part of our
recommendation as shown here,
the committee felt
it's important to sort of
further characterize
and advance our understanding
of how the various aspects
of these pathologies.
And their potential
interactions contribute
to the clinical
manifestations after a TBI.
And importantly, also how
the TBI exposure history,
which has its own complexities,
influences the nature
and extent of those pathologies.
Next slide.
So as I mentioned, there's been
a lot of focus on tau.
This was something that was
first really described
in postmortem examinations
of former boxers many years ago.
As you can see
an example of that
from one of these
early papers on the left.
And then was later described
in various cohorts since,
including other participants
of contact sports,
more severe forms of injury
earlier referred to
as dementia
pugilistica specific to boxers.
And later, the term chronic
traumatic encephalopathy,
or CTE [Indistinct].
So various aspects
of these pathologies,
and you can see here the paper
of the recent consensus meeting.
Various aspects of these
pathologies have been described
as being potentially distinct
in their morphologies
and distributions.
And, therefore, considered
just possibly useful
diagnostically in distinguishing
TBI-related neurodegeneration
from that of other
neurodegenerative disease.
And this was the papers
that outlining
this pathognomonic CTE lesion
that came out of that
NINDS-funded consensus
efforts to define CTE
and these type pathologies
following TBI.
And describes the depths
of critical sulci region.
So and next slide, please.
So there really has been
limited characterizer
over the broader spectrum
of post-TBI pathologies
that have been described
including
some of those described
as being potentially specific
to trauma.
And in particular
how they may be similar
or different
to other pathologies observed
and other neurodegenerative
disease
and perhaps better established
neurodegenerative disease.
And there's been
some emerging reports
that have started using
advanced technologies,
proteomic RNA-sequencing
technologies,
to begin to further
characterize this.
There's also been studies that,
including by our group,
to try and look
at the differences using
immunohistochemistry directly by
comparing to other disease.
And then some also
some interesting work
you can see on this paper
on the right here
from the group in Cambridge
looking at small
series of cases.
And showing potentially
unique aspects
in the structure of tau in CTE
as identified using cryo-EM.
But certainly direct
further comparisons
with other types
of neurodegenerative disease.
And these will offer potentially
important information
relevant to both diagnoses,
as well as offering
potential mechanistic insights.
So as such, the committee
has included recommendations
to apply both traditional
and advanced approaches
to really deeply characterize
these post-TBI neuropathologies.
And comparative analysis
with other NEDs
and neurodegenerative disorders.
Next slide.
So with this diversity
of and complexity
of the clinical and
neuropathological, it comes --
it starts to present
obvious challenges
when we start to think
about how to model
these processes experimentally.
Now there is an experiment
established in literature
on this.
Where various groups have worked
to see if they can introduce --
induce these neurodegenerative
pathologies
and experimental TBI models,
mostly with a focus
on tau and amyloid-beta.
And while we don't have time
to go into
that whole literature in detail,
to sort of summarize it
and saying that it really
encompasses various models,
established models,
the vast majority in rodents,
both with and without
inoculated genetic backgrounds
and considerable diversity
in the sort of mechanics,
and severity,
and approach to injury applied.
There's also been various
outcome measures
that have been examined,
some using immunohistochemistry
to look at pathology,
for example.
Others looking
at biochemical outcome,
biochemistry as an outcome,
looking at changes
and quantification
of cross-correlated tau.
So perhaps not surprisingly,
there's been a large range
in the results from those
where you can see
and some examples
of this work here.
Those where there was observed
changes in tau amyloid
to those where trauma
did not result
in the presence of pathology.
And even some studies
where a regression of pathology
was seen in models
where there was predisposition.
So next slide, please.
So the committee agreed
that really further development
of consistent
and reproducible models
that are clinically relevant.
Is going to be really important
advancing our understanding
of how and why TBI might be able
to contribute
to neurodegenerative processes.
With the recognition
that various aspects of this
are challenging.
Models that accurately reproduce
real-world biomechanics
of injury
is going to be important
and these are obviously
extremely diverse and complex.
Various aspects
of preclinical models
add to the challenges
of recapitulating
those biomechanics,
things like
anatomic differences,
brain size,
weight matter volumes.
And of course, we know
that aspects
of gyrencephalic structure,
these depth of cell
site pathologies
seem to be important.
So gyrencephalic structure
is something of consideration
when thinking
about our models.
Of course, we're talking
about pathologies
that regress over
the order of years,
lifespan may be important.
And finally, I'll just
sort of mention very briefly
in vitro models which have
their own complexity
when it comes to biomechanics.
But may play an important role
in addressing specific
mechanistic questions.
Next slide.
So we're dealing
with these complex
and heterogeneous pathologies
over a long temporal course.
And our group felt
with the data, the human data,
which is still very much
being characterized.
And we've heard of the efforts
to do that,
including data such
as biomechanics data,
neuropathology data,
clinical phenotyping data.
Are going to be really
critical for further
developing
our quantic phase models of TBI
and to inform us really
what is important
to be modeling
and to be relevant.
And then, it's likely
that a range of models
will be helpful in
addressing specific questions.
And of course,
the infrastructure building
that's being described
and Recommendations 1, 2, and 3
are going to be critical for
facilitating those mechanistic
and translational priorities.
So here, the recommendation was
to really promote collaboration,
as Dirk sort of mentioned,
as well, between clinical
and translational researchers
to accelerate
the development
of these
clinically-relevant TBI models.
And my last slide here,
if we move forward one,
is just to mention
this idea of resilience.
We know that many people
with a history of trauma TBI,
including even
very severe injuries
or highly-repetitive exposures,
for example, in boxers.
Don't develop CTE or trauma-
related neurodegeneration
or progressive decline.
And understanding
why this might be might
be helpful and informative.
And we can think about that
in several ways.
There may be people
who just by exposure
are resistant to developing
the pathology,
and thus, the clinical decline
that comes with it.
And there are possible
genetic environmental factors
that then
contribute to them.
And secondly,
there may be individuals
that demonstrate resilience
to the clinical symptoms
despite having TDI-related
neurodegenerative pathologies.
And this brings the idea
of reserve
or pre-morbid factors
that might influence
the clinical trajectory
in some people.
So we really know very little
about this and TBI,
and it's certainly
challenging to examine,
and particularly,
as Kristen noted,
the -- in the latter scenario,
when looking at clinical data.
We don't have enough complex
data clinical impairments
and possibly in recovery
related to injury
to disentangle
from any progressive changes.
So longitudinal studies
will obviously be important.
So nonetheless,
understanding these processes
may be important
in contributing
to our understanding
of mechanisms of disease.
So as shown here,
the committee included
the identification of intrinsic
and environmental factors
and that confer resilience
as our final recommendation.
So thank you, and I will
pass back over to Kristen
for our question
and answer session.
-Great, thank you to Vicky and
to Dirk for those great talks.
If you could go
to the next slide.
Thank you.
So our primary goal today
really is to seek feedback
on these recommendations
to really ensure
that they're consistent
with and reflective
of the stakeholder priorities.
That many of our attendees
today represent.
So let's start.
I see a question
from Mr. Ellenbogen.
-Thank you so much.
I was unable to speak
at the earlier session
and just wanted
to add one comment
before I go
into my TBI comment.
I will have to say
that detection
is a very complicated matter.
And as a person living
with this disease,
I may not want someone to know
I have some kind of dementia.
The second thing,
add some type of dementia
on your medical record,
I instantly have my rights
taken away from me.
We need to change
the laws around that
before we expect our doctors
and the people to come forward.
For example, I would lose
driving capabilities,
depending on what state I'm in,
lose my job or get fired
instantly from it,
or even lose insurances
that I would be entitled to.
So there are things
that need to be addressed
and it's very complicated.
It's just not as easy
as just being able
to diagnose the disease.
But as far as my TBI comment,
we have learned so much about
ways to possibly delay dementia
and we now encourage
that in many public ways.
As an expert who's living
with this horrible disease,
I would not wish this
on my worst enemy.
What I cannot understand,
though,
is that we have learned
so much about TBI,
yet we don't do much
to educate our children
to no longer play games
such as football.
We clearly know that
this will increase their risk
to brain damage.
Why don't we make
this very public
so at least these folks
have a chance?
Thank you.
-Thank you, Mr. Ellenbogen.
You, again,
raise such an important point.
So what I'm hearing
is that we need to consider
in our recommendations,
and our colleagues,
and across the multiple
etiology dementia subgroups.
The potential consequences
of detection and diagnosis
to those living with dementia,
with traumatic brain injury.
And I'm also hearing
a need to for us
to consider
the post-TBI ADRD group
expanding our efforts
to educate the public
about the potential sequelae
of traumatic brain injury.
So that people can make
evidence-based decisions
about their individual
risk tolerance.
Very well-taken point.
Thank you for that.
Let's see, Dr. Schneider,
I see a question.
-Hi, Kristen.
Thank you for the --
those great presentations.
I had a question about
Recommendation Number 2,
which is the clinical
heterogeneity
and the need for more
clinical characterization.
And I'm just wondering whether
or not the biomarker component
should be brought
to the top of that list.
Because as we know
in dementia,
you know,
in all these dementias,
there's so much heterogeneity
in what we see.
And, you know,
do we really expect
that there's going to be
a single clinical feature
that's going to tell us
something different?
I mean, I think we should
certainly be looking,
but wouldn't it,
like the other diseases,
be more important
to have a biomarker,
something that tells us
that there's actually
been injury to the brain.
And so just your thoughts
on that second recommendation
and the elevation
perhaps of biomarkers.
-That's a great thought.
Dr. Henrik Zetterberg,
do you have thoughts on that,
the potential elevation
of biological markers
within Recommendation 2?
-Yes, I think definitely
it can be included
and we should also
separate them,
the acute phase of TBI
with the more chronic phase.
And perhaps also address
what happens in repetitive TBIs
and how one with biomarks
could follow
sort of the amount of injury
to the brain tissue
using the existing biomarkers.
But we would also need
to develop new biomarkers
because the tau that is seen
in chronic TBI,
for example, is not possible
to detect the monitor
using the existing fluid
biomarkers for tau pathogen.
And the imaging biomarker data
will also need
to become different.
So it's almost like we perhaps
should try to also emphasize
that we need to also develop
and validate biomarkers
for TBI-related brain
tissue changes.
So basically
what I'm trying to say
is that we can't just lean back
and use existing biomarkers,
also, because they might
not represent
the TBI-related
pathogens completely.
But acute accelerator injury
and [Indistinct]
calculation works.
There the biomarkers works --
work across
the different types of TBI
and also we can make use of them
developed
for Neurodegenerative dementias.
-Thank you, Henrik.
Pratik, I wander if you have
any comments about this, too,
with respect
to imaging biomarkers.
So part of Julie's point
is that we do not expect
to see one isolated biomarker
but perhaps panels of biomarkers
that we required
for earliest detection.
-Yeah, no.
I absolutely agree, you know,
and I think we need
to emphasize capturing
as much data as possible
from early after the injury.
Where we can characterize,
you know,
the particular
pathophysiological mechanism
operating in that
particular patient.
So...
...all of the acute TBI studies
are generally set up
as precision medicine studies
for that reason.
And once we've captured that
data through imaging biomarkers,
blood specimen biomarkers,
then phenotyping of
the clinical characteristics,
and cognitive function,
and behavioral function
at that acute phase.
Then we can follow
it longitudinally
and see how it evolves
like the slide
you showed from
the different studies
showing how different patients
may have different evolution.
And there's certain
latent classes
that can be discovered
from that data.
So that's a main priority
of a lot of the acute
TBI studies right now
with the qualifications
for multiple years.
And I think that imaging
is interesting, too,
because not only can you
get a biomarker
of the injury pathophysiology
and its progression
or degeneration
during the recovery process.
But there --
you can also get biomarkers
that may be related to
innate resilience properties
that may account for some of
the inter-individual variability
of the recovery process.
You know, despite,
you know, the injury.
So some patients do well because
they have innate resilience
despite a greater severity
of injury
and others do poorly even though
the injury may be considered
mild by standard
clinical criteria.
We see this all the time
and we don't understand
right now the factors
that cause that variability
and our inability
to predict,
you know,
the longer-term outcomes.
So it's going to be important to
characterize in the acute phase
both the injury pathophysiology
and the resilience factors.
And I think that's a common
theme of many of the ADRDs,
as well, where resilience
is taking a larger role
in evaluating the disease
progression process.
-That's a great point.
Thank you.
I agree, we should further
consider this as we revise.
Let's see, I see in the chat
we have a question
from Dr. Bob Stern.
-Thanks, Kristen.
Thanks to the panel
and all the incredible work
you've been doing.
This is just such
an amazing transformation
since the previous time
this was brought up.
I just want to try to bring up
a complex point
between chronic
traumatic encephalopathy
and post-TBI dementia.
And that has to do with
the acute phase of the injuries.
And really what it is
that we're trying to measure
clinically biomarker
and then neuropathologically.
That with the repetitive
head impact
exposure over several years
in individuals
like contact collision
sport athletes.
There may not be a single injury
that would be considered
a symptomatic traumatic
brain injury.
And yet, because
of that repetitive exposure,
there seems to be set in motion
this cascade of changes
leading to a progressive
telopathy.
And in that case, it is
so different to try to detect,
and diagnose, and come up
with clinical features.
Because there's
this period of...
...delay between that time
of exposure to injuries
and then the beginning of
a progressive neurodegeneration.
So I just want to have people
try to keep that in mind
that we're not talking about
an injury that then recovers
and then there can be a chronic
and potentially degenerative
phase later.
When it comes to many
of the cases of CTE.
-Excellent point.
So I'm hearing you say that
it's not quite sufficient for us
to state in our recommendations
that we are interested
in considering a broad range
of exposure histories.
But actually investigating
more carefully the distinctions
between the acute
and chronic pathologies
of distinct
exposure histories.
-That's right.
-Okay. Thank you, Doctor.
-I think that's going to help
really elucidate
the differential pathologies
going on
by differentiating it
at the acute phase.
-Great point. Thank you, Bob.
I see a question now
from Dr. Bellgowan.
-Oh, yes.
I'll turn my camera on.
Thank you.
So there seem to be I know
the Recommendation 4
was about
these translational models
and Dr. Keene showed
a bridge to those models.
But we know that,
you know, so I was --
the recommendation to me
is fairly unspecific
because, you know, TBI,
there's a lot of TBI models.
And are you talking
about developing --
is there a way to develop
a consensus about
which is going to be the most
informative model to use
and to bring in people
from the AD/ADRD community.
To help us choose which models
might be most effective?
I mean, you could even look at
whether we injure a mouse early
and then follow them over,
you know, their life,
or we injure an aged mouse
and see what happens.
I mean, I just see the --
a proliferation
of preclinical studies.
And I was just wondering
if part of the recommendation
was to figure out
which might be the most,
you know, defining which models
and which parameters of models
would be most effective.
And I wrote in the chat the VA
has already put together
a similar effort
for model development
in traumatic brain injury
in itself.
But I'm not sure it includes
the dementia component
of it, really.
-All right, great point.
Dr. Johnson, would you like
to speak to that?
-Sure, yeah. No, I think
that's an important point.
I think one of
the important points
that we were trying to get at
is obviously there's been
an evolution
in our understanding
of the human pathology.
Which is still
very much evolving
and being characterized.
And part of that recommendation
was to really --
so and I think that was what
Dirk was getting to.
Was the picture of the bridge,
as well,
is really that
essentially collaboration
between preclinical
and clinical work.
And there are pathology-based
studies to really inform
what aspects
of these models are relevant
and even potentially
to different populations.
I think there's a lot of work
to be done
even to be further characterized
into the chronic phase
in many of the existing models.
But, you know,
many of these models
are going to be useful
in different respects
for looking at specific
phenotypes of injury
and how they evolve
into the chronic phase.
So I think we were really
getting at the sort of the gap
in information between
the clinical and preclinical.
That's going to be really
important for driving our --
the sort of further
characterization development
and utility of those models.
-Thank you.
Okay, so we will make sure --
we'll take that back
to the committee
and make sure that we discuss
and clarify that.
Thanks, Vicky. Let's see,
Dr. Hoffman, I see hand raised.
-Yeah.
Thank you, Dr. Bellgowan
for that shout out, there.
Yeah, we're -- the VA's working
with the other agencies, DOD,
NIH, different institutes
of NIH, like NIA and NINDS.
To develop these --
a categorization
and standardization
of animal models.
And since the VA
doesn't look at acute injury.
We have veterans
who've had brain injuries.
Sometimes we don't know
what time zero is.
So having models that can show
the pathological progression
of one or more brain injuries
is something that
is a goal of that initiative
which is called precise TBI.
Thank you.
-Thank you, Stu.
Okay, Dr. Corriveau,
I think to turn it back to you.
-Okay. Thank you so much
for a wonderful session
and lively discussion
including specifics
about the recommendations.
We really appreciate that.
So with no further ado,
I would like to --
I'll -- to introduce
Dr. Julie Schneider,
the scientific chair of the
Late Committee for TDP 34 --
TDP 43 Pathology and Common
Late-Onset Dementias. Thank you.
-Thank you, Rod,
and thank you to the organizers
for inviting me.
And I apologize
that you have to listen to me
instead of have lunch,
because I thought
there was a break, too.
Next slide.
Again, the views expressed in
these presentations are not --
are those of the authors
and not of the NIH.
I'm listing all the disclosures
here, both mine, Dr. Wolk,
and Dr. Gitcho,
who will also be speaking,
so we don't have
to each do it on our own.
Next slide.
I want to thank the committee
members Konstantinos Arfanakis,
Maria Corrada,
Michael Gitcho,
Brian Kraemer, Pete Nelson,
David Wolk, Hyun-Sik Yang;
and our cross committee members,
Donna Wilcock and Dirk Keene.
We had lively discussions
and I think just a really good
working group of people.
Everyone pitched in.
And thank you
to the NIH staff too.
Next slide.
So I'm going to give you
an introduction
and then briefly talk about
a couple new recommendations.
I'm going to tell you --
tell you what is LATE,
why do we -- what is --
what are we calling LATE?
Why is it important?
And that's going to be
followed up with Dr. Wolk,
who's going to give you
a lot more information
on why LATE is important.
We, like the TBI session,
we were new to the ADRD summit
as a emerging topic
in the 2019 Summit.
And we've really
come a long way.
Our initial recommendations
involved biomarkers,
clinical manifestations,
basic science, and pathology.
And we're going to continue
with our push for biomarkers
and basic science,
which are really,
really needed in LATE research.
But we're going to pivot
a little bit
with the clinical
and pathology recommendations
and really expand that to two
completely new recommendations
with specific topics
that include clinical
and pathology
but go beyond that to --
and discuss or investigates
the boundaries
with other diseases
in the intersections
with hippocampal sclerosis,
vascular disease, and age.
And I'll talk about those
in just a little bit.
Next slide.
So when we talk about LATE,
we're basically talking
about TDP-43 pathology
in common dementias
in aging.
But the TDP-43 story
really started 2006
with the seminal papers
describing TDP-43
as the ubiquitin positive
tau negative inclusion
of frontotemporal lobar
degeneration, ALS.
So this was a pivotal discovery.
It really changed the field
for frontotemporal
lobar degeneration
and initially very short
period of time
was thought to be specific.
Next slide.
But as we looked
at TDP-43
as this novel neurodegenerative
proteinopathy,
it became clear very quickly
that TDP-43 was not
only positive in frontotemporal
lobar degeneration
but it's positive
in other diseases
just like alpha synuclein
and tau, these misfolded
proteins aren't --
don't define one disease
necessarily.
And, lo and behold,
TDP-43 positivity
was quickly found
to be evident
in Alzheimer's disease,
pathology,
as well as hippocampal
sclerosis pathology.
Next slide.
But even more astounding
was that this TDP-43 pathology
was sometimes found
in older people
completely lacking
Alzheimer's disease,
or hippocampal sclerosis.
And as you'll see
in a following slide,
that is why we came up
with a new name for this
because, as of 2018,
there was no name for this.
And if you look at the pie chart
at the bottom of the slide,
this is a study that we did
looking at people
who are called Alzheimer's
disease in the community.
No biomarkers;
they have an amnestic dementia.
And the red is showing people
with Alzheimer's
disease pathology.
The purple is showing
those people
with Alzheimer's disease
pathology and TDP.
So the vast majority
of these Alzheimer's,
these cases that we see
in the community have TDP.
The blue slice
is showing people
who did not have amyloid
and tau but have LATE.
So they have
a different diagnosis.
The white would be vascular
dementia, Lewy body dementia.
So clearly a big part
of this pie
is being completely disregarded
by the community.
And this was very concerning.
There was very little research
being done.
But at the same time,
it was noted that
in biomarker studies that --
that in biomarker studies that,
you know, a good third of people
who are thought to have
Alzheimer's disease don't.
But most of the research on TDP,
even though we saw
this pathologically,
was really being done
in the FTLD community.
Next slide.
So to increase awareness
and really increase research
in this TDP-43 pathology
and aging
and Alzheimer's disease,
we convened a panel
of 22 experts across 22 centers
and really discuss
how are we going
to make this
a research of focus.
And it's --
and a much needed focus.
And as Dr. Wolk
will be showing you,
that, as an isolated pathology,
it mimics Alzheimer's disease.
But even more commonly,
when it's in conjunction
with Alzheimer's disease
neuropathologic changes
of mixed pathology,
it accelerates decline
and worsens memory.
It makes the person
much worse.
So we clearly know
that this needed to be studied,
and we needed to kind of upset
the field to get it --
to get it going.
And that is where we came up
with the term limbic predominant
age-related
TDP-43 encephalopathy,
which is also LATE,
the pathology is called LATE NC
so LATE neuropathologic changes.
A couple things to mention.
There is no frontotemporal lobar
degeneration in these cases,
and there's not a frontal
temporal dementia syndrome.
Instead, there's a prominent
amnesia of people
with this pathology.
Next slide.
So our 2022
LATE recommendations
continues this dire need
for biomarkers.
We really need
to be able to delineate
when somebody who does not have
Alzheimer's disease has LATE,
and we need to know when someone
with Alzheimer's disease
has LATE in addition
to Alzheimer's disease
because maybe they won't respond
to the amyloid therapy as well.
We need experimental models
to start looking at this age
related TDP-43 update.
So biomarkers,
experimental models,
still really important.
But, in addition --
and I'll show you
in the next few slides --
these boundaries that
you've been hearing
about all of yesterday
and today,
we really think need
to be explored with LATE
and frontotemporal
lobar degeneration,
as well as LATE with Alzheimer's
disease and Lewy Body disease.
And I'll show you a little bit
more about that
in just a minute.
But in addition
to those boundaries,
we also see the need to look
at the intersection of LATE
with hippocampal sclerosis,
which is a very important
pathology in aging.
And especially
as our population ages,
you're going to see
that those numbers continue
to go up
of hippocampal sclerosis,
the vast majority of which
have TDP-43 pathology,
as well as an intersection
with vascular disease
and aging senescence.
And I'll show you a little bit
more about that too.
Next slide.
So here is Recommendation 1,
define LATE pathologic clinical
genetic molecular classification
and diagnostic boundaries
across FTLD TDP, AD,
and other
dementia-related pathologies
and their syndromes to enhance
diagnosis, research,
and awareness.
Next slide.
So here I'm just going to
show you why this is so complex.
So here's --
in the white circle
is Alzheimer's disease
neuropathologic changes occurs,
you know, in a large segment
of the population, as we know.
And then, in red,
you have people
with Alzheimer's disease
neuropathologic changes
who also have TDP, so they have
LATE neuropathologic changes.
So there's a lot
of overlap there.
And you can see
that there's a group
that does not have
Alzheimer's disease
that may have a dementia
just related to LATE.
But, in addition,
I put in a purple circle
because that's
hippocampal sclerosis.
And hippocampal sclerosis
intersects with all of these.
The majority of them
have TDP-43 pathology.
Some of them have
Alzheimer's disease in addition.
In fact, the majority of them
also have Alzheimer's disease.
Next; next, please.
And this is frontotemporal
lobar degeneration.
And I made the circle small
because Alzheimer's disease
is so much more common,
the frontotemporal lobar
degeneration with TDP.
Next slide or next, yes.
But frontotemporal
lobar degeneration
also has hippocampal
sclerosis.
So there's something
really going on with this --
these proteinopathies,
especially TDP-43
and hippocampal sclerosis. Next.
And then there's
Lewy body disease.
So we know already from
the research that's been done
just over the past few years
that Lewy bodies
are independently
related to TDP-43 pathology,
even separate
from Alzheimer's disease.
So, again, we're seeing
this mixture of these different
proteinopathies
being tremendously important.
And these intersections
aren't well-recognized
clinically, pathologically.
They're not studied as well
as they should be studied,
and this has been
brought up multiple times
by multiple people.
And this intersection
with frontotemporal
lobar degeneration
is also very important,
and I'll show you
a couple of reasons.
Next slide.
So it quickly became clear --
and this is just a snapshot
of some papers --
of the clinical
and pathologic overlaps
or, you know, difficulty
in classifying someone's cases
with TDP-43
and Alzheimer's disease
or with frontotemporal
lobar degeneration
and limbic predominant
TDP-43 deposition.
So, clearly, even though we'd
like to make these all separate,
the frontal temporal
lobar degeneration
and LATE, there's cases
that intersect.
And we don't really
understand the intersection
of these different
proteinopathies again,
and a lot more work
needs to be done.
Next slide.
But I don't think
the clinical and pathology
is going to get us
everywhere.
And we need the genetic,
molecular,
and structural boundaries
to really understand.
And you've heard a lot
about that, too,
about the different strains
and different configurations
and morphologies.
But look here
on this first study
where APOE is not only a risk
factor for Alzheimer's disease
but it also increases risk
for Lewy body disease,
as well as TDP-43.
TMEM106B,
a risk factor for frontotemporal
lobar degeneration,
increases TDP-43 pathology
in aging.
So, clearly, these mechanisms
overlap across disease states.
And then, as you've heard
through this conference,
you know, we're learning more
still about what these different
aggregates look like
in different disease states.
Next slide.
-Two minutes remaining.
-So the last thing I want
to talk about is that the --
our fourth and final
recommendation,
which is really
to pay attention
or to study this intersection
of hippocampal sclerosis
in the role of age
and vascular disease.
So we've known about
hippocampal sclerosis
in the pathology world
for a long time.
We know that it can mimic
an Alzheimer's type dementia.
We know it's very common
in the oldest old.
And there's a lot of interest
in hippocampal sclerosis
in the pathology world,
but it's not really noted
clinically very well or studied
from a nonclinical
or pathologic standpoint.
Almost all cases
of hippocampal sclerosis
with aging
have TDP-43 pathology,
but it's not
a specific pathology.
All hippocampal sclerosis is,
is severe degeneration
of the hippocampus in aging.
And you can also
see it interestingly
with apoptsic ischemic injury.
Next slide.
I should also mention that there
are no pathologic standards
for hippocampal sclerosis.
So we have no
consensus criteria.
We take one section of
hippocampus, a huge structure,
and do a six micron section
to look for it.
But we know from that finished
study on the other slot --
slide that it's patchy,
and we might not always
be seeing the pathology.
But we also,
in addition to that,
know that both TDP-43
and hippocampal sclerosis
are age-related pathologies.
And this is a study by Leah
Greenberg and Salvatore Spina,
showing that cerebral amyloid
angiopathy in Lewy body disease
are actually very common in
early onset Alzheimer's disease,
whereas TDP-43 and hippocampus
sclerosis are rarely present.
They're really
an age-related phenomenon.
And we have an aging society,
so we really need to understand
in studies that use aging within
their models what is happening.
And then, finally,
there's inflammation
or there's data suggesting
for multiple groups
now that vascular disease
also intersects.
So here we have
a couple different groups
showing that arterial sclerosis
is related
to hippocampal sclerosis.
We in our group found
that arteriosclerosis
was related
to TDP-43 pathology.
So what that exactly means
or why that would be interacting
is completely
at this point unknown.
Next slide.
-Time.
-Next slide.
So this is my last slide.
So, this is recommendation
number 4.
To study this intersection
with hippocampal sclerosis
and LATE NC within and across
all disciplines again,
not just clinical
and pathologic
but diagnostic,
genetic, molecular,
and to consider the roles
of vasculopathy and senescence
and other potential
contributing factors.
So thank you
for your attention.
And I'm going to hand
the reins over to Dr. Wolk.
-Thanks so much, Julie.
Next slide.
So, I'm going to focus, as Julie
said, on recommendation 2.
We'll talk about our current
understanding and knowledge gaps
in the clinical
manifestations of LATE.
And then I think we'll discuss
where we are now
with clinical detection
of LATE
and kind of where we need
to go moving forward.
Next slide.
So this is recommendation 2.
It is -- sort of builds
off of the prior summit.
It developed -- it's to
develop biomarkers, classifiers,
and risk profiles to establish
an in vivo
diagnostic criteria for LATE
in people in the preclinical
phase of the disease,
as well as those
with an amnestic
LATE life dementia syndrome.
I won't go through
each of these bullet points
because I think they get set up
in the later slides.
But I will point out
the last bullet point,
which is that, ultimately,
we really do need to develop
bio fluid and neuro imaging
and/or neuroimaging biomarkers
of the molecular pathology
of LATE
and, in particular, TDP-43.
However, until we get
to that goal,
we felt that we really need
to develop
probabilistic classifiers
that are validated for us
to be able to do in vivo studies
in this population.
Next slide.
So just wanted to provide
a little bit of context
and in part
because this demonstrates
that we see these cases
in our clinics already.
This is a 78-year-old woman
who had arthritis,
prior hysterectomy for
uterine cancer; and depression.
She had several years
of memory loss.
She would forget
where she parked her car,
and she was misplacing things.
She previously was great
with the computer
and had
increasing difficulty,
and her family felt she seemed
a little more stressed out
and struggled more
with decisions.
Next slide.
These are her initial standard
psychometric testing.
And the important thing
to point out here
is in purple where
she's impaired are all tests
that have to do
with verbal or visual memory.
Other cognitive demands
were essentially intact.
Next slide.
So this was her initial MRI,
and I hope
you can appreciate that,
in the right anterior
hippocampus,
there was some degree
of atrophy.
But there wasn't a lot
of cortical atrophy otherwise
and maybe a little bit
of vascular disease,
small vessel disease.
Next slide.
So she had a very slow course.
We followed her
for over nine years.
On the left, you can see her
psychometric testing,
which kind of barely
changed over time
but did get a little bit worse.
She had poor memory, but
that remained relatively stable.
They noticed some decreases
in her attention and motivation.
She also had a little bit
of disinhibition.
She would say negative things
about people
while they were in the room,
which embarrassed her daughter.
The important point is,
throughout her entire course,
she had a diagnosis
of Alzheimer's disease.
Next slide.
This is her CAT scan
that was done just a few months
before she passed away.
And now I think
you can really appreciate
both anterior hippocampal
and anterior temporal
atrophy bilaterally,
a little bit more
on the right than the left,
and some cortical atrophy
perhaps a little bit frontal
but, otherwise, not too much.
Next slide.
So she went on to autopsy
and was found as
a primary pathologic diagnosis
to have a LATE
neuropathic change
without any evidence
of Alzheimer's disease.
So, again, this would be
an example of a case
that we misdiagnosed
as Alzheimer's disease.
Next slide.
So I think since
the last summit
we actually have made
a fair bit of progress
in defining the clinical
features of LATE.
For example, on the left,
you can see and consistent
with this case
that LATE neuropathic changes
associated with a relatively
slow course of decline
compared to
Alzheimer's disease.
Episodic memory tends to be
the most prominently
affected domain,
and that can be
very significantly affected.
There's still some question
about whether
other domains
are affected
and to what extent,
such as semantic memory.
While these cases
certainly do not have
the behavioral manifestations
of full blown
FTD spectrum disorders,
there's also some question
whether they have
some behavioral associations
such as this case.
The important point is,
when you look at population
and community
based autopsy studies,
these individuals represent
about 1 in 10 individuals.
This is a common condition.
Next slide.
In terms of thinking about
what other kinds
of cognitive
and behavioral symptoms
may be present
in these individuals,
I think it's useful to think
about where TDP-43
spreads in the brain
in the context of LATE.
And I should note
there are three different
staging systems out there,
all with different levels
of granularity.
But the bottom line
is they show regions
that are affected such
as anterior temporal cortex,
orbital frontal cortex,
insula, middle frontal gyrus,
which suggests that there may be
additional impairments
and semantic memory behavior
and perhaps,
to some extent,
executive functioning.
Next slide.
It turns out,
when LATE is associated
with hippocampal sclerosis,
we actually do see
more significant decline
not only in memory but we do see
involvement in semantic memory
and perhaps to some
extent perceptual speed.
Next slide.
So -- and this touches a little
bit on recommendation 4,
but we really need to understand
the clinical phenotype
that differentiates LATE
with hippocampal sclerosis
versus LATE without
hippocampal sclerosis.
But as Julie mentioned,
we also really need
to study the drivers of LATE.
We do know some things about
how hippocampal sclerosis
presents in the setting of LATE.
These individuals,
as I mentioned already do seem
to show more severe
cognitive impairment,
particularly memory,
but they also tend to have
a higher or later stage of LATE
in terms of the spread
of TDP-43.
So it's not surprising
that these individuals
have other domains
of cognitive impairment
like semantic memory affected.
As was also mentioned before,
these individuals seem to have
some relationship
with vascular disease.
They have a higher rate
of atherosclerosis
that's been described.
Interestingly,
the genetics of LATE
alone versus LATE
with hippocampal sclerosis
may differ as shown
on the right.
And, importantly, as we are
starting to develop
these sort of genetic risks
of LATE,
these are features
that can be included
in classification models
as we move forward
to define the disease in vivo.
Next slide.
So we've been talking about
LATE neuropathic change alone,
but I think one of the really
important areas
is how it interacts with other
neurodegenerative conditions,
particularly
Alzheimer's disease.
So on the left is relatively
new data from 13 community
and population
based autopsy cohorts,
which suggests that up
to half of individuals
who have late stage
Alzheimer's disease,
neuropathic change also have
LATE neuropathic change.
And, importantly,
in the combination
of Alzheimer's disease and LATE
seems to be associated
with a much accelerated decline
over time that we see relative
to Alzheimer's disease.
So it's really the fastest
progressing form
of Alzheimer's disease
in some ways.
And, actually, if you look at
different stages of Alzheimer's
based on Braak stage,
at any of those stages,
the presence of LATE is
associated with poor cognition.
Next slide.
So detection of LATE
in clinical populations,
I think,
is critically important.
It's a common source
of cognitive impairment
in older adults.
And in clinical diagnosis
of Alzheimer's disease
probably makes up 20%
of the attributable risk.
It has important prognostic
and potentially
treatment implications
and amnestic cognitive
impairment presentations.
A slower course is expected
in someone
who has it in
the absence of Alzheimer's,
but a much more rapid course
is expected in patients
who do have
Alzheimer's disease.
And, really, our ability
to be able to detect it in vivo
is what's going to allow us
to do broader studies of risk,
genetics, clinical
and cognitive phenotype
and eventually
intervention studies.
I think, though,
critically important
to the Alzheimer's
disease field
is that it's a major source
of variability in progression
that can impact clinical trials
and may also limit the efficacy
when specifically targeting
AD pathophysiology.
And, currently, there are
no molecularly specific markers
of TDP-43.
Next slide.
So then how can
we detect it now?
And, again, there have been some
progress since the last summit.
For one thing, there are spatial
patterns of neurodegeneration
based on atrophy
or hypometabolism on PET,
which can be suggestive
of LATE neuropathic change.
And they've been linked to post
mortem data to various extents.
One also can inferentially
determine the likelihood of LATE
based on Alzheimer's
disease markers.
So Alzheimer's disease
is defined
by the presence of amyloid
and tau biomarkers.
And neurodegeneration is used
to sort of stage individuals,
the so-called ATN framework.
Well, if an individual
is amyloid negative
with an amnestic syndrome,
particularly if they have
atrophy in a LATE like pattern,
they're much more likely
to have LATE.
But we really want
to be able to detect it
when individuals also have
Alzheimer's disease.
And what we know is,
within that Alzheimer's
disease continuum,
tau is tightly linked
to neurodegeneration.
So if an individual
has significant medial
temporal lobe atrophy
and a LATE like pattern
in the absence of tau pathology,
that may suggest LATE.
Or if they have tau pathology
but neurodegeneration exceeds
what we expect,
that, too, might be a marker
to use for LATE.
Next slide.
So, again, there have been --
there has been work showing
that there are spatial patterns
to change that occur with LATE
that may differentiate it
from Alzheimer's disease.
So, for example, on the left
is post mortem work
showing amygdala patterns
of atrophy or shape change.
And on the right
is a study we did
where we looked
at antemortem MRI
and found that Alzheimer's
disease with TDP-43
tended to have more anterior
medial temporal atrophy
than Alzheimer's disease
without it.
And, actually, if you took
a ratio of anterior
to posterior MTL,
there was fairly
good discrimination
between these groups.
Next slide.
-Two minutes remaining.
-We also have seen that there
are cortical patterns
of atrophy in LATE.
So, for example, on the left
is a post mortem study
showing atrophy
in temporal polar regions
and frontal regions.
And this has also been seen
in vivo as well,
where in particular, again,
you see this gradient
of greater anterior
than posterior temporal
involvement. Next slide.
There also have been
FDG PET signatures of LATE,
some really nice work done
by the Mayo group,
which has found
particularly severe medial
temporal hypometabolism
relative to inferior
temporal hypometabolism.
And this discriminates between
Alzheimer's disease and LATE.
And if, in more recent work,
if you add orbital
frontal cortex,
that further increases
discrimination.
Next slide.
But, again, we can establish
the diagnosis
inferentially through
AD biomarkers.
So this is a case
of someone
who's 83 with
an amnestic presentation
who has had positive
amyloid marker but negative tau.
Next slide.
However, they also had
very significant
hippocampal atrophy --
next slide -- as well
as a little bit of athero.
So this is a case
that had neurodegeneration
in the medial temporal lobe
without tau.
And so we might expect a non AD
driver of Alzheimer's disease.
Next slide.
And, indeed,
this was a stage two LATE case.
Next slide.
We've also been trying to look
at the relative amount
of tau to atrophy.
And I've had -- found people
who have more atrophy
than expected
for a given level of tau.
And, in fact, some of those
individuals have that increase
or mismatch of neurodegeneration
in LATE-like regions.
And, actually, we can cluster
these groups together
using machine
learning based approaches.
Next slide.
-Time.
-And what we've found is that
there's a limbic
vulnerable group
and a limbic resilient group.
But, importantly,
the vulnerable group
tends to have high levels of
TDP-43 in post mortem analyses
whereas the limbic has,
if anything, low levels.
Next slide.
And just very quickly, to end,
I think we need to bring all of
this knowledge into the clinic
by incorporating
multiple biomarkers
for probabilistic models,
including cognitive data
risk factors and genomics.
And all of this, though,
needs to be validated
and replicated
in large post mortem studies.
But, again, ultimately, we
need to find TDP-43 biomarkers.
And so I will now turn the mic
over to my colleague,
Michael Gitcho.
-Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about
experimental models
of LATE that incorporate aging
and relevant phenotypes.
There's nothing --
recommendation is to build
new experimental models
that incorporate
aging with behavior,
pathological,
molecular phenotypes
of TDP-43, proteinopathy
or hippocampal sclerosis,
advanced knowledge enable
testing and therapeutics.
Overall, to develop
and characterize models
that incorporate aging,
designed to simulate latency,
TDP-43 dependent clinical
and pathological phenotypes
potential. Next.
There are mobile models
to study aging
and maybe looking
for innerve generation
with nontraditional models
may be --
may be helpful in understanding
the disease better.
Next, please --
was talking about this
really exciting paper
that came out
by our senior colleagues
that using nicarwine maps
of TDP-43,
they're able to map
TDP-43 pathological filaments
aggregation from ALS
with an FTLD case,
two cases they looked at.
This is real exciting
because previously,
this C terminal region,
this glycine rich region
has been fairly undefined
until now.
And we can start to --
and understanding the structure
will give us a better idea
as far as understanding
disease mechanisms,
maybe possibly development
of drug targets,
in addition to maybe develop
even some PET ligands
that may be useful
detection of TDP-43.
And I guess the big question
to ask on this, too, is,
is the structure
of these pathological filaments
of TDP-43 in AOS
FTLD different in LATE,
and maybe that will be
determined at some point.
Next, please.
So to look at this,
we're going to --
one of the recommendations
is to look
at virally transduced
animal models using age animals.
Caudry and Associates
looked at 10-
to 12-month-old mice
using the cAMP
kinase tetracycline
response element,
the doxycycline
response element.
So they introduced AB virus
with specific expression
into the hippocampus
using this model,
model regulatory expression.
And they show that just over
15 days post transduction
TDP-43 causes neuronal loss in
the hippocampus in stage 2 here.
There's no change
with alpha synuclein.
I think it's important
to emphasize
the use of multiple pathologies
when it comes to look at these
changes with TDP-43 in LATE
to maybe possibly use
this together in sync
with the same animal
to look at some nucleon or tau
or other pathological
proteins together.
Next, please.
Knock-in, gene edited,
or stress induced models.
Deboin colleagues
looked at this,
developed these humanized
knock-in lines
that are driving TDP-43
along SO D1, also FAS,
but driving TDP-43 using
the endogenous promoter,
humanized lines as they possibly
can be used
for introducing
mutations for FTLD.
But this could maybe
be applied to LATE as well.
Introducing modifications or
seeing what changes occur here,
looking at this
endogenous promoter.
Next slide, please.
Stress induced cellular models.
Roddy and Associates
looked at this,
and they use
an oxidative stress model,
but arsenide treated,
fibroblast or IPS motor cells.
It's important to note on two
on this phosphorylate
TDP-43 aggregation
to look at all the bio
for cellular models
in particular to look at --
be able to replicate aggregation
as far as changes in solubility
and to have
the biochemical signatures
with the cleavage products
and other things as well.
But this could be
definitely used as a model
to maybe use for drug studies
or other ones as well.
Next slide, please.
Next slide, please.
No. Back one.
I'm sorry.
Can you go back. There we go.
Now we're good.
So interaction between TDP-43
and other pathological proteins,
tau, alpha synuclein,
amyloid proteinopathies
and other pathological
proteins, Tomie and Colleagues
found an interaction
between TDP-43
and tau
using immunoprecipitation
but also show
some colocalization
between phosphorylated
TDP-43 and phospho tau
in pre AD
and symptomatic AD cases.
Next slide, please.
She and colleagues
looked at an interaction
between TDP-43
and amyloid beta.
They show a complex interaction
here through immunoprecipitation
This is kind of
an interesting study, too,
because they used bilateral
interhippocampal injections
of recombinant
full-length TDP-43.
This has been a challenge
in the field
for isolating
recombinant TDP-43 this stage,
so this is real exciting.
And this goes back to
the structural component, too,
that we're starting
to understand
as far as
a structural understanding
these pathological filaments
that maybe
that could be utilized
too as far as injecting --
well, later on.
Next slide, please.
One thing that would like
to focus, too,
is to develop models
for vascular contributions
of TDP-43 proteinopathy
or hippocampal sclerosis.
We really need models
to develop this
and to be able to see
these changes
and how they
can be replicated
or at least be consistent
with those with LATE.
Glial and neuron interaction
plus inflammatory contributions,
that's a TDP-43 proteinopathy,
specifically as aging.
We'll see to replicate
within the models,
what we're seeing
in the human disease.
Next slide, please.
-Study the transmission
of pathological TDP 43,
the prion-like transmission
of pathological TDP 43 species
that simulate anatomical
progression latency,
TDP pathology
in common dementia.
This is a great classical
experiment from Luton College
that did a --
used a small peptide
of mutant alpha-synuclein
into stereotactic injections.
And they show,
over the course of time,
it causes this prion effect
to affect endogenous
synuclein-inducing pathology
across the spread of the mice
in just a few months.
They further looked
at this same model,
the same group, azoladel.
And then they looked at
synuclein and how it modulates
tau pathology as well.
I think because of
the recent discovery
of the structure
of these filaments,
that we're going to see
more prion-like -- to invest --
to be able to investigate
this prion-like transmission,
or pathological TDP 43 species,
using this type of system.
Next, please.
Next slide, please.
Transgenic animals that express
wild-type or immune TDP 43
or developed
hippocampal sclerosis.
Back one, please.
Back one slide, please.
Thank you.
So, Wuhan colleagues
did a conditional knockout
in the hippocampus.
And, over the course of time,
at 12 months of age
they show distinct degenerate --
distinct severe
hippocampal degeneration
over the course of time
at 12 months of age.
Next slide, please.
This is unpublished work
from our lab.
We looked at
hippocampal degeneration
as seen in 24-month-old mice
expressing nuclear localization
signal defective TDP
at 43 months.
These are in --
these are six genotypes
that we looked at
with wild-type APP-PS1,
a low expressing TDP mouse.
And it's TDP in the mouse
expressing lower TDP
43 expression
in an APP background.
They show no neuronal loss
at 24 months of age.
And they show no change
in hippocampal area.
However,
when we derive expression
of TDP 43
in the cytoplasm --
and this is end stage
for these mice.
These mice only live 24
to 25 months of age,
the NLS mice in particular.
When we derive TDP 43
in the cytoplasm,
we get this severe degeneration
of the hippocampus.
And we get a decrease
in hippocampal volume.
And in the end
in the APP background,
there's no additive effect
with these.
And this will go
into the next slide,
where I can talk about
model limitations.
Next slide, please.
So, model limitations
I want to talk about the cAMP
kinase model,
that I described
for the one that we use.
Gowan and Associates
from Jackson lab
is an excellent paper.
They mapped quite a few
different transgenic lines
for their integration sites.
And it just so happens
the cAMP kinase TTA model
that we use was mapped in five
coding regions, the gene.
And there's, also,
some abnormalities
with some motor deficits
in these mice
as well that show
some clasping later on.
So, this brings us to rigor
and reproducibility.
And I think we can --
if we think about this
for animal models,
this has been a challenge
for reproducibility
on animal models
from consistently.
If we look at, for instance,
the APP-PS1 model,
we can see that there
are multiple groups.
There's maybe
over 1,000 papers
or so that describe this model
and characterize it.
But multiple groups show
early age-dependent changes
at three or four months of age,
or even five months of age,
they show memory deficits
where other groups don't show it
'till they're 12 months of age,
or even 18 months of age.
Same mouse, same background,
same experiment.
The environment may play
a big role in this,
and this may be
the handling of the mice.
And how this can be addressed,
I'm not really sure.
But, take suggestions.
But I think that age is really
going to be a key factor
with this
understanding this, too.
And that's going to be
hypothesis-driven for LATE.
And that's going to be up
to the researcher.
We're suggesting single copy,
maybe endogenous promoter,
inducible expression, or other
approaches to replicate LATE.
Next slide, please.
Next slide, please. Thank you.
So, this is an overview
of the recommendation
is to build
new experimental models,
and incorporate aging behavioral
pathological phenotype.
And I talked about developing
and characterizing models
that incorporate aging,
designated to --
designed to simulate latency.
Barley transduce models
knock in,
gene-editing stress models,
transgenic models
that express to the wild-type
or mutant TDP 43.
Consider using inducible
promoters
to derive expression,
disease relevant cells.
But attention has to be played
to the appropriate time
of life in the animal.
The vascular contribution
to TDP 43 proteinopathy
hippocampal sclerosis
is going to be important
to develop, too,
as far as models.
And the interaction of TDP 43
with other
pathological proteins,
and understanding
those pathologies is important.
In addition to glial
neuronal interaction,
plus inflammatory and
neuroinflammation contributions
to TDP proteinopathy
to be able to model this in --
they're replicates
of what's seen in LATE,
specifically in aging.
And then study
the prion-like transmission
of pathological
TDP 43 species
that simulate anatomical
progression of latency.
With this structure now,
we may be able to develop
good candidates
for different areas
of the protein,
in order to induce
these changes.
Maybe starting it
in the amygdala,
and seeing how
the transmission progresses.
Next slide, please.
-Two minutes remaining.
-Next slide, please.
So, in general,
we want to develop
translationally actual cellular
and animal models,
to enable preclinical
therapeutic development,
and testing pipelines
and latency.
Most of the models
to date focus on ALS or FTLD.
And we've just seen
we really need models
that replicate LATE,
and other models of LATE.
Not just animal models,
but other models
[Indistinct] as well.
We need to study this in the
context of multiple pathologies.
It's important to look
at these interactions
in more of a complex nature
with TDP 43,
as we're seeing it
in the human disease.
And we may be able
to model it better
by looking in more pathological
proteins in that.
And then what's real important
is the intersection
with the hippocampal
atrophy and vascular disease,
and developmental models
or other systems as well.
But in all of the models,
aging should be
incorporated in everything,
as far as I understand.
I want to thank you
for your time.
And the next part will be
the Open Mic and Questions.
Thank you very much.
-Thank you so much.
So, we have a question
from Penny Dacks.
-Thank you all.
I've got to say, I learned
so much listening to all of you.
And I deeply appreciate
your work here,
and your leadership
in this space.
I was -- you know, Dr. Gitcho
just spoke on the models.
And I think his --
and supplied your ability
to convey so much complexities
about how do we --
when we take the complexities
and we try to distill it
into models,
sometimes we go too far.
And I think you did
such a phenomenal job
discussing how there's
so many different ways
that we can be using
the models in a deeper way,
to be looking at
the interaction of factors,
rather than solely distilling
them down into singular ways.
I want to encourage
the group to consider
looking at long-term
sleep impairments as well,
because I do think
there's a lot
that's there that we don't
fully understand
when you're going
at aging biology.
And, in general, systems biology
and computational models
I think are important
to consider.
But my core suggestion
is, really,
just to emphasize
the broader mixed etiologies
dementia
recommendation at round,
building proactively
towards harmonized data
and biosample collection,
so that the work
that's happening on TDP
43 within all of the ADRDs,
as well as related fields like
ALS, can really be able
to benefit from each other.
We don't yet know,
and I don't think we'll know
for a long time,
how much, you know,
the biomarker work in one space,
or the basic science
work in one space
is actually going to be relevant
to a related space.
And I hope that one day
we can get to the place
where our clinical phenotypes
are being very carefully
and [Indistinct]
characterized for prognosis,
but that the underlying
molecular pathology
is what is being defined
in individuals,
so that that is what
can be tackled
clinically with new therapies.
Thank you all.
-Thank you so much.
Those are great points.
And I've written them all down.
I think the harmonization
is super important.
And I think we do have that
in some of our bullets,
as far as recognizing
that need for harmonization,
as well as this intersection
with frontotemporal
lower degeneration,
harmonization
with other diseases
that might be
in their own isolated coves.
Eric, Eric Smith?
-Yes, Thanks, Julie.
My question is,
"Are we ready for provisional
diagnostic criteria
in vivo like probable
or possible LATE?"
I'm a neurologist
and a clinician scientist.
I think I recognize
this syndrome sometimes,
or a pattern like
what was described, right,
with the slowly progressive
amnestic syndrome.
And I was encouraged
to see all the work
on like hippocampal volumes
and patterns of atrophy.
Are we ready to try
to identify prospectively,
and then follow people
and validate
pathologically?
Thanks.
-David?
-Thanks so much
for the question.
And I'll be interested to hear
what other panelists say.
I do think there are cases
that we see clinically
that I feel fairly
comfortable nowadays,
particularly if we have
rich biomarker data
for classifying them,
as having LATE.
I think, LATE alone has
relatively distinctive features
associated with it,
that we probably could
create criteria,
that, again,
probabilistically would give us
a reasonable degree of certainty
about the underlying pathology.
I think, in the context
of Alzheimer's disease,
it obviously gets trickier.
But, again, I think there are
features in the imaging,
as well as cognitively,
that may allow us, again,
to kind of probabilistically say
there's a high likelihood
of LATE copathology.
But I'll let the others
weigh in as well.
-David?
-This is a great session.
Thanks for doing this so far.
I was going to comment
on the issue
that I think it's going
to be very difficult
actually to study this
in live people
without a marker
of the pathology.
And I think,
until we get there,
it's going to be
where we can rule out
AD pathology
with biomarkers or in.
But I just would feel
very uncomfortable
diagnosing somebody
with this,
with the current information
that we have.
Now that we have cryo-EM
of TDP 43 structure, I mean,
you theoretically
should be able
to develop
an imaging agent for it.
At least in the patients
I see that.
I mean, most patients
who come to clinic,
not research,
don't even get AD biomarkers,
let alone anything else, so...
-Right. So, yeah.
Yeah, I think
that's a great point.
I mean, you know,
in the population-based
studies
and community-based studies,
it would be
exceedingly hard to do.
It would definitely have to be a
research study with biomarkers.
Pete?
-Thank you very
much to everybody.
Thank you, Dr. Schneider.
And I agree
with both David's points
that we need better biomarkers.
However, there are
a lot of people
now that are getting
screened for AD.
And when they have some
degree of neurodegeneration,
or some cognitive wobbling,
but they screen failed,
there's no option for them.
That's it. They're done.
And we've seen that
from the patient advocacy
here that there's a lot
of frustration with that.
Well, here at University
of Kentucky,
we have what I think is
the first LATE clinical trial.
And, so, we can employ
the information of screen
failing for an AD
clinical trial,
and give somebody an option.
And I really think
that what I believe
I'm hearing from the patients,
patient advocacy,
is a little bit of a disconnect
to what I'm hearing
in the AD dementia
neurology field
of trying to be
a little bit more proactive
about giving patients options.
It's not telling them what to
do, but giving them options.
And to try to get shots on goal,
to see if we can't start to bend
some of
the cognitive trajectories
in the survival curves.
So, for us, we have people
that are clearly cognitively
not totally intact,
and having some MRI changes,
but are negative
on the amyloid biomarkers.
And we have an option for them
to get into clinical research.
And at least it's a start.
And, so, I think that
that's a really important --
at least trying to get
on the hill of effectiveness.
Other areas of research,
like cancer,
have been much more proactive,
and have reflectively
gotten much better results
than we have in
the dementia research field.
-Thank you, Pete.
David, did you want to respond?
-Yeah, I agree with, actually,
both David and Pete.
And I think
they are great points.
I think, to David's point
about clinical practice,
in general clinical practice
I do think it --
you know, we just don't get
the biomarkers
to make the diagnosis there.
But I do think that we can
establish some criteria
in research cohorts.
And, again, that is kind of
a goal of this,
you know, committee is to push
for more harmonized data
collection across different
studies and populations.
And I think that will ultimately
allow us, again,
probabilistically, just like
how we used to diagnose
Alzheimer's disease
in the past,
to, you know, allow us to
at least classify individuals,
perhaps incorporate genomics
and other factors that also
help stratify individuals,
and their likelihood of --
the point's obviously well taken
that we really do need
a molecularly specific biomarker
to truly move
the needle forward.
-Dave? David?
-Yeah, I think we should
definitely be
enrolling all people
who might have LATE into
our research studies for sure.
I mean, one possibility
would be
if you think somebody has LATE
based on other criteria,
on all the criteria
you discussed,
I mean, maybe there
can be clinical trials
done in those for people,
if the target is not
necessarily, you know, TDP 43,
but something that is
present in everybody,
that you might try to hit,
but they wouldn't be
in an AD trial,
because they don't have AD.
-Right.
-Right.
So, not
specifically amyloid or tau,
but if it's an inflammatory --
-Right.
-Mechanism or something else.
-Right. Exactly.
-Right.
No, those are all great points.
And, interestingly, you know,
this intersection
between TDP and vascular,
I think is going to become
more and more important.
And I think -- you know,
we have Maria on our team
with the 90+ Study.
And I know from our cohorts,
you know,
in those over 90,
what are we seeing?
We're seeing TDP
and vascular disease.
So, it's very common.
It's going to be increasing.
The neurologists
are going to see more
and more of these cases
as time goes on.
This is not going away.
So, yeah.
Anyway, the last comment I think
was from Susanne Van Veluw. 16
-Thanks, Julie.
Yeah, to your point, actually,
Julie, you mentioned a role
in the intersection
between TDP 43
and vascular disease.
And I wonder might there be
a role for impaired
perivascular clearance
as a disease mechanism.
We heard a great deal about it
yesterday in the VCID section.
And I was wondering
if that could be
another
potential causal mechanism
that's worth considering
as a focus of interest.
And, if so, if you agree
if that be a good addition
to the recommendations.
-So, does anybody on the team
want to take that one?
No, perivascular clearance
mechanism people on our team?
I, personally, think
it's a great idea.
You know, there's huge interest
in the vascular field.
And I don't know
if Donna's still on,
but she was part of our team.
The perivascular clearance is,
you know, highly topical
in the vascular disease,
VCID, session.
And, certainly, when we talk
about this intersection
between neurodegenerative
disease and vascular disease,
especially small
vessel disease,
I think it is something
that we should highlight.
So, I appreciate the comment.
And I think
we should highlight that.
And we can discuss it
among our committee.
-Just to add, Julie.
Hi, everyone.
So, just to follow up
on that, Susanne,
you know, when we talk
about the perivascular
kind of drainage pathways
in the VCID recommendations,
we talk about solutes,
and, you know,
neurodegenerative proteins.
We're not specifically
talking about amyloid.
So, I think that does open up
kind of that recommendation
to being draining --
you know, clearance of TDP
43 clearance of other,
you know, proteins as well.
So, yeah, it's a good point.
-Yeah, and maybe something
we can at least touch upon
in our recommendations, too.
-Julie, very quickly,
I just wanted to mention that
before it was mentioned
that many of these
are age-related pathologies.
And one of the things
that will be important
to kind of try
to disentangle is that,
especially like with vascular
and TDP 43,
are they there co-occurrent
because it's just
a factor of age?
Or is it because
they actually have
a mechanistic interaction
in some way?
So, I think that's an important
point to try to disentangle.
-Right. And I agree, Maria,
it's really important.
And, you know,
residual confounding
is certainly a possibility.
We controlled for age
in our studies.
I'm sure Pete did, too.
And we looked at that
pretty carefully.
But, yeah, these are people
who are surviving.
These are people in their 90s.
Right? So, you know,
association doesn't mean
that there's causation.
So, that certainly is something
that we need
to figure out still.
Pete?
-I would say -- thank you.
I would say a couple other
things are also maybe relevant.
We found that
arteriosclerosis connection
with TDP 43
and hippocampal sclerosis.
But Dr. Selenich's
animal model,
where they do
the viral transduction with TDP.
it's very interesting,
because it produces
both an HS phenotype into mice,
but also perivascular
sort of changes as well,
and gliosis that seems
to be deleterious.
So, it seems to recapitulate
a number of the features
of the pathology.
And I think Dr. Selenich's model
is a very interesting one,
that allows both aging TDP
HS-like and vascular changes.
So, I think it's really
provocative.
-Thank you, Pete.
So, we have a question --
or a comment from Ian Premmer.
-Hi.
I think Keith wanted me on
to reiterate something I --
just a small comment
I put in Q&A.
And please understand
none of this in any way reduces
the importance of the point
that Dr. Nelson made.
But in response
to two points ago
that he made about the patient
and family advocacy
community wanting more options.
I think that's completely true
and critically important.
My minor quibble is I think
the data is pretty clear
that those advocacy communities
are not primarily interested
in extended lifespan.
They're primarily interested
in expanded
health span quality of life.
So, those things
are not at odds.
But the primacy is on what can
be done to improve the here
and now in the short term,
even if sometimes that may be at
the expense of the longer term.
Because it's end stage dementia
that scares the bejesus
out of people, rightfully.
And where there is
maximum opportunity
for improved quality of life,
may be at earlier stages.
Hence, the urgency
to have better
means of detection
and diagnosis with precision.
Which I think goes back
to Dr. Nelson's point.
We want options
as we are working
toward greater precision,
greater accuracy,
greater, therefore,
actionability based on
a differential diagnosis.
So, I think I'm in complete
agreement with Dr. Nelson.
But he is, certainly,
welcome to tell me
if I've missed the thrust,
or misrepresented his view.
-You a thumbs up from Pete.
-Thank golly. Okay.
-But I, also,
want to point out that,
you know, LATE is interesting
in that it is
very slowly progressive.
So, when we see people
with LATE, you know,
they have
some mild memory problems
that very slowly progress.
So, their quality of life
may not decline,
or isn't declining as fast
as people with Alzheimer's
or Alzheimer's plus TDP 43.
So, I agree with you.
But I do think that there --
that that group is important.
David? Or Dave?
-Just to piggyback
on top of that.
That's why, you know,
correct diagnosis
is also particularly important
in that group,
because being told
that you have Alzheimer's
has a different connotation,
at least to some patients.
And, so, some of these cases
are more likely to be slow.
And I think it's important
for us
to get the diagnosis right,
so that we have a better sense
of what the prognosis
is in those individuals.
-If I could just add
one more quick point,
you know, following
on piggybacking on that point.
There is -- often, I think
we all are sensitive to this,
a lot of prescription nihilism.
And it's misplaced,
because so many people, not all,
but so many people in the
patient and family communities
want to know what we are facing,
and what we aren't,
even in the absence of,
never mind a cure,
even an effective
disease-modifying treatment,
or even a symptomatic treatment.
It just helps to be able
to put a name to it.
Or in the case
of multiple etiology,
mixed dementias,
put names on them.
So, we know what we're facing,
we know what we're not.
And, so, we can enroll
in the right clinical trials,
if we are privileged enough
to have access to trials at all.
-I agree. Pete?
-And this is just something
to make a point
about that,
actually,
in Dr. Schneider's excellent
introductory talk was made.
But it needs to be underscored
that you think about LATE or AD
and C,
but they're frequently combined.
Not only is it such that
LATE is a little bit more mellow
than AD per se.
And the combination is worse
than either alone.
Which is intuitive.
But the very important point
that Dr. Schneider's data
showed better than anybody's
in the world
is that pure LATE
is the least common,
but it's still quite common.
Pure AD is a little bit
more common,
I mean,
significantly more common.
But even more common
than that is the combination.
So, this combination is where
LATE actually exerts itself,
and where it's a bedevilment for
the clinical trials as well.
So, I think that more people
need to be much more aware
of this combination,
because it's the most common
and the most impactful of them.
And, so, we need to have better
therapeutics and diagnostics
for both of those scenarios.
-And awareness
across research,
as well as
non-research communities.
-Thank you for
a wonderful session.
I think we probably need
to stop there,
unless anybody has
a burning comment
they'd like to finish off with.
We're going to go ahead
and restart at 2:25
with the Special Session
on COVID-19 and AD/ADRD.
So, thank you so much, everyone.
And we'll see you back soon.
We're going to start
the next session
of this ADRD Summit 2022.
It gives me great pleasure to
introduce the Scientific Chair
of the meeting,
Dr. Natalia Rost,
who will bring us
into the session
on impact of COVID-19
on AD/ADRD risk and outcomes.
-Thank you, Rod.
Homestretch, everybody.
That's the last session,
last scientific session
of the meeting,
before the general
and the closing.
And we're excited as part
of this new working group
brings to you a topic
that is of most urgency
and necessity
to investigate in deeper detail.
Namely, the impact of COVID-19
on ADRD risk and outcomes.
And I'm delighted to pass
the baton to my Co-Chair,
Dr. Sudha Seshardi,
who is Director
of the Glenn Biggs
Institute for Alzheimer's
and Neurodegenerative Diseases
at the University
of Texas San Antonio.
Sudha?
-Thank you, Natalia.
And it's my distinct honor
and privilege to work with you,
and with an outstanding
team of diverse experts,
to address this important
emerging topic on COVID
impact on AD/ADRD risks
and outcomes.
So, I'll touch
upon the introduction,
scope of the problem,
and the recommendations that
this working group arrived at.
And then colleagues
in the group
will expand on our thinking
behind these recommendations,
and what we know at present
about different aspects
of this infection. Next.
These are the opinions
of myself and our committee,
and not official NIH policy.
And this is my disclosure.
Next.
And we have --
I have to extend thanks
to all the outstanding members
who served on this committee,
three of whom will be speaking,
as I do, on behalf
of the whole group.
They pulled together
in a very short time. Next.
And we were charged with
making four recommendations.
And we ordered them in the order
in which we thought, logically,
these need to be done.
But all are equally important.
And we are recommending that all
of them be addressed right away.
Although they may continue
to be addressed
for varying periods of time.
The first priority
the group emphasized
was the need
for research infrastructure
to be established,
infrastructure in clinical,
epidemiological
and basic research studies
of the COVID-19 impact on ADRD.
Prioritizing
disproportionately affected
and vulnerable populations
with a view
to having
clinical trial readiness
as quickly as possible.
So, for this, we believe
the second recommendation
was to focus on characterizing
the clinical phenotype
of neurocognitive
consequences of COVID-19,
and developing
diagnostic criteria,
both in persons with
and those without
pre-existing neurocognitive
impairment and dementia
at the time
that they became infected.
The third priority
was to recognize
that this is
a complex issue,
and explore the interaction
with social, structural
and systemic inequalities,
comorbidities,
and social
and medical interventions,
both the access and specifics
of the interventions,
on the risk and cognitive --
sequelae
of neurocognitive
deficits after COVID-19.
And equally important
was to understand
the basic mechanisms underlying
this neurocognitive impairment,
so that we can develop
appropriate biomarkers,
establish risk profiles,
and lay the foundation
for early interventional trials.
Next.
Next.
So, I'll be touching
on the epidemiology and biology
as we know of SARS CoV-2,
why we think there may be
an excess of this pandemic
with AD/ADRD,
and what are the types
of infrastructure
we are talking about.
And my colleagues,
Professor Avindra Nath
from the NIH
will address neuropathology,
Professor Gabriel
de Erausquin
will address
the clinical spectrum
and the modifying
systemic factors,
and Professor Serena
Spudich from Yale
will speak about biomarkers and
possible promising interventions
that we might study.
Next.
So, this -- next.
This virus is an RNA virus.
It has and it's called
the spike protein.
Which is how the virus
enters the cells.
But it's, also,
how vaccines confer immunity.
And then there are the
nucleocapsid proteins presence
of immunity
to which can address --
can suggest that there
was native infection,
and not just vaccine-induced
immunity. Next.
As of a month ago,
over half a billion people
were known to have been
infected with this virus.
And, likely, there are
many more unsuspected cases,
so that as much as one
in 10 persons worldwide
have had this infection.
Next slide.
And we know that over time
the virus has evolved.
So, you have had
the Delta surges,
recently the Omicron surge.
And, next, unfortunately,
large parts of the world,
the areas in brown,
remain very poorly vaccinated.
And, so, the virus
is likely to spread
and evolve in these regions.
Which may lead to persistence
of the pandemic. Next.
So, why worry about ADRD
in the midst of this pandemic?
Next. Some of the early reasons
for alarm, next,
were that we know SARS and MERS,
which are similar coronaviruses,
could affect the brain
in some patients.
We know that anosmia, which is
characteristic of COVID-19,
is an early sign in some
neurodegenerative diseases,
like Alzheimer's
and Parkinson's.
And the last time we had
a pandemic of this proportion,
there was delayed
post-encephalitic parkinsonism.
Next.
There was, also, alarm
because there was a suspicion
of trans-synaptic transmission
from the olfactory mucosa
into the brain, next,
as well as perhaps
trans-endothelial are carried
by macrophages movement from
the blood system into the brain.
Next.
However, at autopsy, the virus,
or even evidence
of past viral replication,
is rarely seen.
Next.
And, so, there are
a number of theories,
some of which
you will hear about,
about how the virus may be
having the unquestionable impact
on thinking, memory.
Some of it may be that the virus
enters certain glial cells,
and other parts,
through receptors,
such as the H2
receptor in urapalin.
There is endothelial damage,
micro trauma
by the impact of both systemic
as well as local inflammation,
as well as changes
in neurotransmitters.
What is unquestionable
is that there are symptoms.
Next.
What we do not yet know,
because the virus has only been
with us for two years,
is that are these
mostly temporary.
Clearly, in some people,
they appear to be persistent.
And might they be progressive?
And what is the biology
around this?
Here, I do want to emphasize
that the working group
recognized that ADRD
is a broad umbrella.
We are not necessarily
only wanting to focus on amyloid
and tau pathology,
nor suggesting we know enough
to suggest that the virus,
in fact, increases
the risk of traditional AD.
But ADRD does also include VCID.
It includes all the conditions
that have been discussed
over the last two days,
as well as immune-mediated
cognitive decline,
sequelae of sexes
and inflammation.
Here is an opportunity
to study this area,
as well as other mechanisms
like mitochondrial dysfunction.
Next.
And, so, we need models.
And, unfortunately,
we are just at the beginning
of developing cell
and animal models.
And, also, we need
to understand
their translational relevance
to human disease.
Some of the models that have
been developed include,
next, IPSC organoids
and assembloids
that have neurons
and glial cells,
vascular and perivascular cells
susceptible to the virus,
next,
zebrafish with H2 receptors,
next, where you can see
the impact of the spike protein
in inducing immunological
and inflammatory changes.
Next.
Some mouse models that appear
to be susceptible
to COVID-induced,
next, anosmia resulting
in being unable to detect food
or partners of the opposite sex.
How relevant are these models?
These are things we need to
study in the translational way.
Next.
We need to query the data hidden
in electronic health records.
We already have data suggesting
that the risk of COVID
is doubled in persons
with pre-existing dementia.
It's, also, clear that
certain populations,
like African-Americans,
are more vulnerable to COVID,
having three times
the risk of Whites. Next.
Is it, also,
true that these populations
are more vulnerable
to ADRD type pathology
developing or accelerating
after COVID?
And, if so, why?
Next.
One suggestion was that,
in the pandemic,
caregivers were already
under stress,
persons living with dementia
were less able
to follow precautions,
and may suffer from withdrawal
of things like social support.
Next.
So, was the higher risk entirely
due to behavioral
and environmental factors?
Next.
There is a suggestion
that there was some biological
and genetic factors
as well that may underlie the
higher susceptibility to COVID
in persons with dementia.
In this study from Finland,
3,000 hospitalized
now patient cases
were matched to controls
in this Finland cohort.
And persons who had APLE 4
were more likely to have severe
COVID,
to have micro hemorrhages,
and also to have
post-COVID mental fatigue.
So, genetic studies may help
with risk prediction,
as well as understanding
the biology,
and perhaps finding
intervention targets. Next.
In the GEN-COVID,
which is looking
at the genetics of COVID,
some genes not previously
strongly associated with AD,
like oligoadenylate synthetase
1, were identified.
And then, subsequently,
it was found
that these may have
a role in AD as well.
Next.
For instance, the OAS1 gene
seems to determine
whether microglia are more
in the interferon
responsive subtype,
or the amyloid response
of an amyloid removing subtype.
And if you have
a genetic variation
that predisposes you
to have more microglia
of the interferon
responsive subtype,
the hypothesis goes
that you may be more susceptible
to both AD
and severe COVID.
Again, this needs to be
validated in further studies.
But this is the preliminary
data. Next slide.
So, what are the kinds
of infrastructure
we wish to emphasize?
Next.
We, next,
want to recognize
that there is opportunity
in the pandemic,
in that factors
beyond biology,
factors such as national
health policies,
and the effectiveness
in controlling the pandemic,
may also have a role in whatever
we see in terms of sequelae.
For instance, when
the global burden of disease
looked at depression
and anxiety,
not surprisingly,
during the pandemic, it went up.
But it, also, went up
more in countries
where the health policies
and effectiveness
in controlling COVID
was less.
And this is, again,
understandable. Next. So --
-Two minutes remaining.
-Next. We recognize
that there are many factors,
such as the virus
and variations in the virus,
next, as well
as indirect factors like access
to physical activity
and diet, next,
as well as, next,
modifiers in the environment.
And, therefore,
our recommendation, next,
emphasizes the need
to carefully ascertain details
about the infection
and treatment,
as well as the impact
of policy interventions,
like paid family leave,
as well as the role
of access to care,
and the possible benefit
from innovative technologies
like telemedicine. Next.
We emphasize the need to use
established clinical cohorts,
like the NIH, NINDSC
4R, the UK Biobank,
which you'll hear about later,
as well as new
longitudinal cohorts,
like the recovery effort,
existing dementia cohorts,
like the ADRCs and NAC,
as well as the cohorts that were
exposed to acute trials,
like monoclonals that might
reduce the severity of COVID.
Next.
And to record --
to collect fluids and use novel
imaging techniques,
next, harmonize the various
measures of cognition
and other modalities, next,
so that we can rapidly implement
in parallel candidate
drug screening.
And with this natural history
and biomarkers known,
go forward for treatment tracks.
Next.
-Time.
-We will be looking at both
population-based,
hospital-based,
and other types of clinics,
next, novel methods
that look at areas
that may be susceptible
to MRI --
to COVID, such as
the locus coeruleus
and the olfactory lobes, next,
and emphasize
longitudinal data collection.
Because there may be
a delayed impact of the virus
that is only detectable
with repeated assessment. Next.
So, I'll now hand
over to my colleague,
Professor Avindra Nath,
to discuss the neuropathology
of the virus.
-Thank you, Sudha,
for the wonderful introduction.
And so I'm going to talk
about the neuropathology.
And if you look at the various
syndromes associated with COVID,
can be divided into
three major categories.
One is during the acute phase
when the patient is admitted
to the hospital.
At that time, there is
a lot of end-organ damage,
and so there's no surprise
that the brain is going
to get involved.
However, the brain can be
directly involved
by vascular disease
and very, very rarely,
are there any cases
of true viral encephalitis.
Then you have
the subacute phase
where these are largely
post-viral syndromes,
but they're all
inflammatory syndromes.
And you can see them with almost
any kind of viral infection.
So they are acute
disseminated encephalomyelitis,
necrotizing encephalopathy,
limbic encephalitis.
So they are mediated by very
specific types of immune cells.
And then there's
a unique syndrome
associated with the virus
in children
that is called multi-system
inflammatory syndrome.
Well, we're going to spend
a lot of time
talking about
chronic manifestation,
which is long COVID.
Next slide.
So just as Sudha said,
you know, the concern was,
early in the pandemic,
that can the virus
really enter the brain.
As you can see here,
in the cribriform plate
is this very thin piece of bone
that's separating the brain
from the nasal cavity,
and there are all these
olfactory nerves
traversing this
cribriform plate.
So the question is,
can the virus really get in?
It turns out that
the olfactory nerves
themselves never get infected,
and what gets infected are
really the sustentacular cells,
which are the support cells.
So next slide.
And so if you actually look
for virus in these regions,
what you find
is that the olfactory --
because it has
a lot of virus, okay?
And the olfactory bulb
and the tubercule,
very rarely do you
find any virus at all.
So it really stays
in the mucosa.
And as you can see
on the right-hand side,
these small viral particles,
these round structures
are viral particles here
that causes
a huge amount of virus,
and because of that,
that's where it stays.
Next slide, please.
So there are other groups
that have detected small amounts
of virus in the brain,
but you find it
very infrequently,
and when you do find it,
you don't find any inflammation
around the areas
when they detect them,
so we don't think that is
of much pathogenic significance.
We, and several other groups,
have failed to detect
any virus in the brain
using a wide variety
of very sensitive techniques.
Next slide, please.
And what I want to emphasize
is that the major pathology
really is vascular injury,
and I think that has a lot
of implications
for microvascular disease
and Alzheimer's-like pathology.
So next slide, please.
And so the vascular pathology
can present
in many different ways.
You can get frank infarcts.
You can get bilateral infarcts.
You can get brain
and other organ systems
where blood vessels
can get occluded.
And then there are individuals
who can get microhemorrhages
and other individuals who can
occlude the venous system,
and you can get cerebral
venous thromboses as well.
Interestingly, the study here
looked at microhemorrhages,
and what they found was
that those individuals
who are APOE positive
are at greater risk
of developing hemorrhages,
looking at different
parts of the brain,
as you can see here.
And there's more
severe hemorrhages,
and more areas are involved.
Next slide, please.
So besides frank hemorrhages,
you can also see --
without the presence
of hemorrhage,
you can still see
microvascular pathology.
And here, what we did is,
we did postmortem MRI scans,
and these are very
high-resolution scans
using 11 Tesla scanner.
And you can see,
these blood vessels here,
they look abnormal.
And when we stain them
for fibrinogen,
which is a protein
that should be present
only in the blood
and not outside,
you actually see
the leakage of fibrinogen.
So these blood vessels
are really very leaky.
So they aren't leaking RBCs,
but they're leaking proteins.
Here in the olfactory bulb,
you find the exact
same thing, too.
There was a lot
of fibrinogen there.
But within
the blood vessel itself,
you can see aggregation
of platelets.
So this is another form of
microvascular disease here now.
Instead of them leaking,
the endothelial cells
are activated
to whereby the platelets stick
to them, and they get activated.
And you can see occlusion
of the small blood vessels
here as well
from these platelets.
And what we find is that you see
it more often in the hindbrain,
which is the brain stem
and the cerebellum,
and we looked
at all kinds of controls.
You don't really see them.
You only find them --
it's quite specific
for these COVID patients.
Next, please.
There are some individuals
who developed tinnitus,
acute onset of ringing of
ears.
It's associated
with loss of hearing.
And next slide, please.
And others that would develop
acute onset of vertigo.
We think these are actually
vascular phenomenon,
and that is possible
that the small blood vessels
supplying the inner ear
get occluded
because it's fairly sudden onset
in these individuals.
Next slide, please.
Okay.
Then there's the subacute phase.
Next slide.
And as I said, you know,
you can get acute
disseminated encephalomyelitis
as shown over here.
This is largely
a T-cell-mediated phenomenon.
Some get necrotizing
encephalopathy,
which is largely
a cytokine-mediated phenomenon,
so those things are
very important to recognize
because they're treatable
very differently,
and the long-term implications
are also different.
Next slide, please.
And then, in children,
you can get this
multi-inflammatory syndrome.
As you can see on the screen,
in the corpus callosum,
there's a high-signal
intensity lesion here
and loss
of inflammatory markers.
So the long-term
consequences of this
are not fully understood.
Next slide, please.
Then, as I showed you earlier,
you know,
there's leakage of proteins,
but if you look
for the cellular infiltrates,
you find they're
largely macrophages.
I think they're coming in there
to clean out
all the proteins
that are leaking,
but once the macrophages
enter there, they don't leave.
So they will cause a lot of
damage to surrounding tissues.
You hardly ever find
any T cells,
and that tells you that,
if it was a viral encephalitis,
you should see
a lot of T cells.
You actually don't see any.
No.
And you got
astrocyte activation here, too.
Yeah, next slide. You can get
peripheral nerve involvement.
So you can see
the cranial nerves
as well as the roots
coming out
can get inflamed
and involved as well.
So you can get widespread
peripheral nerve involvement.
Next.
And in some patients,
you can also get myositis.
As I said,
inflammatory myositis,
that responds to treatment
with high-dose corticosteroids.
Next slide, please.
-Two minutes remaining.
-Next slide.
Well, what is important
is that most patients,
they will recover early on
for about three months or so.
If they don't recover
by three months,
most of the symptoms
start to persist,
and you see it more often
in women as compared to men.
That again suggests to you
that it's an immune-mediated
phenomenon,
most likely.
Next slide.
So there are these individuals
who, as I showed you,
they have severe symptoms
initially.
They gradually got better,
but not completely.
Then there are other individuals
with mild symptoms,
they get better, but after
a certain latent period,
they then get
new symptoms again.
Okay. Next slide.
And we looked at a cohort
of these individuals.
Almost all of them
have cognitive abnormalities
as well as fatigue
and then a whole host
of neurological symptoms
that are to a lesser degree.
Next slide.
And so you can divide
these patients into four groups,
some that have largely cognitive
and mood and sleep disorders,
and I think that's the category
that you're more interested in,
but there are other types
of long COVID syndromes
that can present
in these individuals.
Next slide.
And PET scan shows
that these individuals
have decreased uptake of glucose
in a more symmetric manner
involving the cortex.
So the cortex
is diffusely involved
in these patients
in the subacute group.
Next slide.
And this very recent study
from the UK
shows that there is also --
they looked at this cohort
before
and after development of COVID,
and it was a unique cohort,
that the total intracranial
volume is decreased.
There is hippocampal --
the gyrus is actually decreased
and preferentially
and is associated with
impairment of cognition as well.
So I think this is actually
quite concerning,
and long-term follow-up
will reveal what's happening.
Next slide, please.
-Time.
-Okay. Next slide.
I'll just skip this one.
-And eventually, you can
actually see neuronal loss here,
and we've shown that
in the brainstem.
Note when you get
activated microglia,
you can see loss over here.
Next slide.
So, in conclusion,
direct invasion
of the brain by SARS is rare,
and neuroimmune dysfunction,
I think,
is by activation
of innate immune responses,
and endothelial damage
is the primary
pathophysiological process
in Nero-COVID.
Next slide.
And these are
our acknowledgements.
I'd like to thank
each other people
who helped us
with obtaining the tissues.
Serena and I ordered a review
on this quite recently.
And these are the people
in my lab who did all the work.
So I'll stop here. Thanks.
-Yes, Professor Erausquin.
-Thank you very much.
I'll get straight into it
in the interest of time.
My run is to cover
the clinical side
of the neurocognitive
dysfunction after COVID-19.
Next slide, please.
I don't have any disclosures.
Next slide, please.
And this has been
a topic of concern
right from the beginning
of the pandemic.
The publications about cognitive
impairment in initial case
reports began
in the immediate months
after the onset
of the spread of the virus
and have continued to increase
over the past 18 or 20 months.
What's more remarkable is that,
from very early on,
the public eye
also caught interest
in this particular phenomenon,
those initially described
by patients,
by sufferers, as brain fog.
Next slide, please.
The source of data have become
increasingly sophisticated.
Initially, where I also
mentioned case reports,
then more protracted,
more extended case series
began to appear
involving
primarily hospitalized patients
during or immediately after
the acute phase of the illness,
and those follow-up
appointments in clinics
describing persistent symptoms,
as Dr. Nath already mentioned.
But better quality data
perhaps and more relevant
from the point of view
of the neurological importance
of this particular phenomenon
began to appear
in surveys of patients
who were well characterized
and being followed as part of
longitudinal cohorts,
such as the ones
that Dr. Seshadri mentioned,
including Nath
the framing of her study
or the San Antonio
Mexican-American
pharmacy studies,
which had --
all the individuals
who had been well characterized
and followed for
a protracted period of time.
The biggest disadvantage
of those cohorts
is that the relative number
of affected individuals
was small and persists
rather small.
So the better quality data
are beginning to emerge
from new cohorts developed
from population-based databases
or registries
and include all individuals
who have been
tested for COVID
during the course
of the pandemic,
whether they came back
positive or negative,
and that will be where I would
focus more of my comments.
Next slide, please.
For instance, again,
as Dr. Nath already mentioned,
there are good quality data
from separate port of patients.
This is coming primarily
from the UK biobank
that Dr. Seshadri mentioned,
pointing to the fact
on the left top panel
that persisting symptoms
are quite sustained.
Once they're present,
after the few initial weeks
of the recording of the illness,
they don't seem to go away.
More notably, the bulk
of those symptoms
and the ones
with highest probability,
they are on the bottom
left panel --
brain fog, memory issues,
and difficulties with language.
But if you disclose a bit more
on the top right panel,
you find that include
primarily short-term memory loss
and word-finding difficulties.
What's most remarkable is that,
if you consider the presence
of the symptoms
on average across age groups,
they seem to be, you know,
more or less the same across
different strata of aging,
but when you disclose
that in greater detail,
it turns out
that younger individuals
have more much
prominent problems
with attention, concentration,
and executive dysfunction,
as opposed to true
fewer memory problems
that appear to be
much more prevalent
and severe
in other individuals.
Next slide, please.
In the largest US-based study
that was published
by Biden's
administration recently,
they found that
the neurocognitive decline
was actually two times
more common in individuals
who had suffered COVID
and recovered within
a relatively short time,
30 days after recovery
than in historical controls,
when they looked at
a very large sample
of close to 6 million people
or contemporaneous,
so having controls
that did not have
the disease
in equal large number.
So this is quite clearly
a unique phenomenon
to recovery from COVID.
Next slide, please.
What's most important
is that it's not
just when you compare
the individuals that recover
from COVID
to the general population,
but also if you compare them
with individuals
who recovered from other,
similar respiratory
flu-like syndromes.
And in this particular case,
the comparison was made
to influenza.
And you can see that, as far
as six months after recovery
from an acute respiratory
severe illness,
flu-like illness,
if the illness was COVID,
the likelihood
of cognitive impairment
is almost two-fold
that of the patients that
recovered from the regular flu.
The pattern of symptoms
is actually similar, too.
Again, to what Dr. Nath
mentioned, quite broad.
It includes things
such as fatigue, muscle pain,
other forms of bodily pains,
occasionally anxiety
and depression,
but more prominently,
cognitive impairment.
Next slide, please.
The predictors
of this COVID impairment
that appears to be
quite peculiar
to recovery from SARS-CoV-2
or to the infection of COVID
are still open to question.
I'm going to show you
two studies
from different sources of data
that lead to somewhat
different conclusions,
and I will go back to this point
a little bit later.
On the bottom two panels,
what you see is data from the UK
biobank.
So these are retrospective data
on patients across the board
who had suffered COVID and most
of whom were hospitalized,
but as you will see
in a moment, not all of them.
It's a very large sample.
And on the left panel,
what you see is the prevalence
of what they called
dementia-like symptoms,
meaning prominent impairment
in several cognitive domains,
including memory, language,
and executive function.
And this was compared to other
respiratory tract infections,
patients who had recovered
from other respiratory
tract infections.
You see again that
the likelihood of developing
these chronic symptoms following
COVID is almost two-fold.
And this was
much more prominent
in the post-hospitalized
patients who had encephalitis,
and that's the red line here,
compared to the dotted
line there,
which are hospitalized patients
without encephalitis,
or inpatients who were
not hospitalized
the length here
that did not have --
compared to those that did not
have the respiratory infection
in the bottom dotted line.
So the bottom line is,
in the UK biobank data samples,
severity of the disease,
particularly having encephalitis
or being hospitalized,
resulted in much more likelihood
of having
dementia-like symptoms.
The top part,
on the other hand,
is the community-based
sample for Amerindians
from Northern Argentina
in the Andes Mountains
that shows that mechanical
ventilation, ICU admission,
or oxygen dependency during
the acute phase of the illness
did not predict
a positive outcome,
and on the other hand,
the presence of persistent
anosmia several months
after the recovery, did.
Next slide, please.
-Two minutes remaining.
-What this translates to is
to a very large increase
potentially in cases
of cognitive impairment
for the US population
as a whole.
If you consider that as many
as 3 and 1/2 million cases
of new cognitive impairment
will be present in the next two
or three years, you know,
assuming that this data remain
as they are now,
that would represent a more
than two-fold
increase in the number of cases
and a large increasing burden.
Next slide, please.
What's most concerning
is that this may not be
evenly distributed
among different subpopulations
within the United States.
Indeed, we don't know
if rate of infection
or rate of hospitalization
will result, as I mentioned,
in higher increases
in cognitive decline.
But we do know that
under-represented populations
are at much higher risk
of having severe disease
and having hospitalization.
So there is a chance
that they may also sustain
a much larger burden
of disease.
Next slide.
This is particularly important
because,
as I mentioned,
in the Amerindian population
that we started
with the registry,
the severity and frequency
of cognitive impairment
reaches about 40% of the sample.
Next slide.
So, as next steps,
I think we need to concentrate
on understanding
what are the variations
in the clinical phenotype of
neurocognitive amoralities
following COVID that are just
now beginning to be described,
and particularly
the relationships of clinical
manifestations
with underlying biology
as Dr. Seshadri described
in great detail.
I think it's of
the highest importance
to establish and detail a course
of this cognitive impairment
as well as histology
resiliency cultures
and possible targets
for myofibril risk,
and we need to understand
the role of variations
in the viral genome
as well as the interactions
between the various variants
and host risk/resilience
factors affecting
this cognitive decline.
Environmental factors,
including social structure
and systemic inequalities,
appear to have profound effects
in the morbidity
and mortality of COVID,
and it is really urgent
to understand
if they will also affect the
long-term cognitive outcomes.
Thank you very much.
-So thank you very much for
inviting me to give this talk,
and as I'm following a couple of
really fantastic presentations
that really, I think,
set this talk up very nicely.
So the focus of this talk
is really looking at biomarkers
of COVID-19 and thinking about
what they may be able
to teach us about potential
clinical trial targets for AD
and ADRD-related to COVID.
Next slide, please.
So I have no disclosures.
Next slide.
So, again, I'm reflecting
and following up
on three wonderful presentations
that have really highlighted
the questions that are laid out
for us in identifying biomarkers
and disease treatment
targets.
And just to take a step back
to the clinical presentations,
of what the clinical
presentations have taught us
about pathophysiologies,
underlying neurological
and psychiatric conditions
in acute COVID-19,
a really fantastic
UK-wide surveillance study
has looked at cases of people
reporting to the hospital
with clinical presentations
that relate to COVID and neuro
and psych symptoms.
And I think what
their investigation
has really highlighted
is that there's different
pathophysiologies
underlying the conditions,
as we've heard from
the previous presenters.
So in this graph,
in the first column,
we have
cerebrovascular disorders,
and these are organized
by relative frequency of onset
related to the onset
of respiratory symptoms.
And the cerebrovascular
disorders in the first column
are starting very early
and even pre-dating
the COVID-19
respiratory symptoms,
but the other disorders
highlighted in the red boxes
here are disorders
that we typically think of
as being immune mediated
or inflammatory diseases,
as Dr. Nath pointed
out beautifully.
Many of these started
a week or two
after the onset
of respiratory symptoms.
And I think that
what this highlights
is that there are
diverse pathophysiologies,
and we really need to try
to understand all of them.
Next slide, please.
So thinking about acute COVID-19
and what kinds of biomarkers
have been revealing
and seemingly showing us
what some of
the biological mechanisms
are in these conditions.
And you heard about inflammation
and looking actually
at autopsy samples,
but in fact, cerebrospinal fluid
has been collected
in limited numbers of people
who have had acute COVID-19,
and they have also revealed
neural inflammation.
This is a very small study
of only six people studied early
in the pandemic who had
neurological complications
during acute COVID-19,
and these samples revealed
elevations in biomarkers
of immune activation,
such as neopterin
and beta-2 microglobulin
in the spinal fluid.
Here on the left,
you can see that the dotted line
is the normal value
in healthy control subjects,
indicating that inflammation was
very prominent in these people.
At the same time,
this group did not definitively
detect SARS-CoV-2,
and again confirming
what's been pointed out
in previous talks that
viral invasion does not seem
to be a prominent
part of the disorder.
Next slide, please.
So other CSF biomarkers --
and you saw this
slide briefly earlier --
have also been looked at,
and I think this is particularly
of interest in a group
that's concerned about the onset
of neurodegenerative diseases.
So again, in acute COVID-19,
CSF samples that have been
collected in people with COVID
and neurologic symptoms
have revealed changes
in amyloid processing,
so reductions in soluble amyloid
precursor protein
and amyloid beta
during acute COVID-19
with neurologic symptoms.
I think, again, this is
something that raises concerns,
but we really don't know
the long-term implications
of these findings.
Next slide, please.
How about blood samples?
And I think it's been
very fortunate
that, of course, blood has been
much more readily detected,
readily measured
and collected for research
purposes in patients
with COVID-19.
So this is a much larger study
coming out of NYU
that collected blood
in 246 individuals
who had acute COVID-19
while they were hospitalized.
And this study very nicely
compared levels
of neurofilament light chain,
which is a marker
of active neuronal injury,
as well as glial
fibrillary acid protein,
which is a marker
of astrocyte injury.
And this study revealed
quite robust elevations
in both of these markers in
people who had acute COVID-19,
and they very nicely
compared those to people
who they considered normal,
healthy controls as well
as those
with mild cognitive impairment
and active Alzheimer's disease,
showing that the extent
of these elevations
was really quite marked,
even compared to the individuals
with neurodegenerative disease.
I'll say that both
these changes,
as well as the changes
in amyloid precursor proteins
and amyloid measures,
are also seen in other acute
infectious conditions,
including an acute
HIV infection.
So I think that
we have to look at this
as a marker
of an acute injury
that may not have
long-term clinical effects.
Next slide, please.
A much more sort of
in-depth research study
has been recently
conducted here at Yale
by one of my collaborators,
Dr. Shelli Farhadian,
where she looked not only at
markers in immune activation --
and this is looking at
CSF cytokines on the left
where those in purple
are those with COVID-19
and those in green
were healthy controls --
and showed that
the CSF cytokine patterns
were not only abnormally
elevated in the COVID patients,
but they actually were different
than the cytokines
observed in the blood,
suggesting that there's
a compartmentalized
immune reaction.
She also found that
there was an elevation
in the frequency of B cells
in the cerebrospinal fluid.
And when the B cells --
since B cells
produce antibodies,
she investigated
whether or not the antibodies
seem to be directed against
SARS-CoV-2 or some other target.
And in all of the examples,
there were antibodies
detected against SARS-CoV-2
in the spinal fluid,
and some of these differ
than the patterns
of those in the blood.
But interestingly,
some of these antibodies
also were autoreactive
to brain tissue,
suggesting an element
of autoimmunity
underlying some
of these conditions.
I'll say that I also indicate
on the slide that, again,
looking for presence of virus,
very few published cases
have detected SARS-CoV-2
in spinal fluid --
less than 3% of
published cases --
suggesting again
a neuropathogenesis
that's really immune mediated
and potentially
vascularly mediated,
as you've heard
from Dr. Nath,
rather than a direct
viral infection.
Next slide, please.
So moving to this issue
of long COVID --
and I think, here,
we have many more questions
than we have answers and data,
but one can imagine that some of
these underlying conditions
that we're seeing in people
who are having persistent issues
after recovery
from acute COVID-19
could be related to some of
the pathophysiologies
that are seen in acute COVID.
Next slide, please.
-Two minutes remaining.
-Great. So one possibility
is that persistent inflammation
or ongoing immune activation
or abnormalities is underlying
some of the longer-term
complications of COVID
after recovery
from acute illness.
I have to say, I think we have
very little clear evidence
that that's actually true
at this point,
but many studies are ongoing.
This is a tiny study
of individuals
who had cancer
and neurologic symptoms,
and those in red here
are shown
who have cancer and neurologic
symptoms after COVID,
versus cancer and neurologic
symptoms without COVID.
And in this study, there was
a higher CSF inflammatory score
in those people who had COVID.
Next, please.
Another nice study
has looked at individuals
who were prospectively studied
from the time
of their acute hospitalization
and then three months later.
And in this study, individuals
who had very high baseline
blood inflammatory markers
were more likely to have
long-term depression
and neurocognition abnormalities
at three months. Next.
I think both of these studies
are just little hints
that these may be issues,
but we really need to understand
how these relate
to more long-term symptoms
in people who have
had milder disease.
Next slide.
What about
neuroimaging biomarkers?
You heard again from Dr. Nath
already about another study,
different from this one,
that found regional
hypometabolism,
changes in glucose uptake
in the brain of individuals
after COVID who were having
long-term neurologic symptoms.
And in this study,
the PET metabolic values
were actually related
to the degree of symptoms,
such as changes in memory,
pain symptoms, or anosmia.
Next slide.
-Time.
-So you also heard already
about this UK biobank study,
and I think this is also
very convincing
and concerning that,
in people in whom data
was available before
and after COVID,
there were regional changes
in brain structure size.
Next slide.
-So, with apologies, Serena,
we have to go
the question and answer.
-Yeah. That's no problem.
My last slide
is just really a summary
of the questions
to be looked at,
so the next slide,
you can just show this one,
and looking at targets
for treatment.
Thank you so much.
-Thank you all very much.
Really appreciate that.
So we're going to go to the Q
and A for this session.
I think everyone's gotten
the hang
of putting their name
into the Q and A box.
We have a few people
there queued up.
Dr. Rost, I don't know if you're
going to want to enter,
talking to the question askers,
or do you want me to do it?
You're muted.
-Natalia, your sound
is not working.
-Yeah, your sound
is a little funny.
So why don't I do it first?
Dr. Dacks, Penny Dacks, you're
the first questioner for us.
-Thank you.
Hi, Penny Dacks again with AFTD.
Though I should say
that I'm not commenting
right now on behalf of AFTD
but as a family member
of two very sick people,
including a 10 year old child.
There's a lot that I think
we still need to disentangle,
right, in terms of,
and I think you guys
did a really great job
of outlining
the different areas
there where we've got aspects
of long-term chronic stress,
social isolation,
anxiety and depression.
And we know from epidemiology
for years
that those all have links
to dementia onset
that may not necessarily
be long-term pathological
factors there.
And we can assume that severe
acute COVID infection
that has hospitalization,
that has ventilation
is going to pose hypoxia
for one thing that could have
immediate acute effects
on vascular function,
on the underlying
neuropathologies of the ADRDs.
And we have this third situation
where you've got young people,
right,
who had mild acute infections
that are having this long COVID,
of chronic fatigue, anxiety,
depression, headaches,
neurological symptoms,
all different kinds of stuff.
And every single one of those
different clinical situations
are profoundly important
to understand.
When we think about
how this is going to impact
their long-term risks
of dementias.
And I just wanted
to put a plea out there
that we are very, very careful
about how we define
the work that we do.
Because the work that's
being done in the hospital
as patients who have
severe acute symptoms,
I think biologically
could be very, very different
from what's happening
in the more mild acute
but chronic situations.
So it's really just a plea
that as we come up
with a nomenclature
and as we come up with
how we define these things,
we are very cautious
with the data
that we put in there
to make sure
that these are the separations
across these categories
of clinical situations
can be more readily understood.
So that if you've got blood data
that's being drawn
from the clinic,
for example,
in the hospital, you can better,
you actually know how severe
was that initial acute infection
and separate that out
from the people
who are two years out
still having severe
cognitive problems.
So thank you for
all the work you're doing.
-Thank you so much
for that personal perspective
and those important points
Serena, did you want to respond?
-Yeah, sure. That's
an absolutely critical point,
and I think one
of the major gaps
that we have in knowledge
about what's happening in
the nervous system in COVID-19
is actually in people
who have mild disease.
Most of those individuals
are never enrolled
in research studies,
and even now, we have very
little sort of, you know,
ability to capture
those kinds of data
in people who have
acute COVID-19, right.
And then there are concerns
for research participation
and infection risk.
But it may be that it's a very,
very different type of trigger
of symptoms and of syndromes,
and the biology
may be different.
So we're taking clues from
what we've learned from people
in whom data and sample,
et cetera,
have been able to be collected.
But I think thinking about
how there may really
be different categories,
and the nomenclature
is absolutely critical.
And one of the things
we've learned from COVID
is there's incredible
heterogeneity in this condition,
in all organ systems
in all ways.
And we have to be very accurate
and careful
making sure we don't
group things inaccurately
because then we will not
necessarily
make the right decisions and
recommendations going forward.
-Thank you.
-Professor Bovenkamp.
-Well, Gabriel
has his hand up first.
Sorry, my voice,
my mike is back on.
-Thank you, Natalia.
Yes, I agree.
I think those are
hugely important questions.
And not just questions
at this point
but rather what appears
to emerge
as the one supported line
of thought
which is that the disease
in milder cases,
that are detected
in the community
that have not been hospitalized
that have,
you know, cold symptoms
or a mild flu-like syndrome
and normal chills
has chronic manifestations
that are phenotypically
different from those
who had severe incapacities
or other acute severe illness.
And they, the point
that Dr. Nath made
which is that this is going
to be, manifestations of this
is appearing more common
in women,
is true only for
the younger population.
Not necessarily for
the older population.
But that's one of
the phenotypic differences.
Another one is that
in the younger individuals,
the cognitive symptoms appear
to be most prominently
in attention and difficulties
with sphere of processing
as well as some
executive dysfunction.
Whereas with all
the individuals,
the most prominent feature
in at least half the individuals
appears to be intense
episodic memory impairment,
more resembling
what you would expect to see
in a patient with early
Alzheimer's disease.
So I agree. These are massively
important questions.
And there are enough data
readily available to suggest
that there may well be more
than one clinical picture
emerging in
the chronic space.
-Thank you, Gabriel.
Diane, Diane Bovenkamp.
-Yeah.
So yeah, so I just had
a number of questions kind of,
this has been a really
great session, thank you.
I think, and I think
in terms of detection,
we need to be able
to detect it even
if they don't have COVID
listed in their record, right.
There needs to be a way
to detect it
because of the stigma
associated with it
and people not wanting
to miss work, right.
So and then talking about,
you know,
women might get it more,
and then are there
comorbidities?
We need to mark that.
Are people who already
have inflammatory diseases,
are they more prone to it?
So this is where we need
to collect the big data,
and we're all about
the data sharing.
That's pretty important too.
So but one of the things
that Avi was saying
was the vascularity.
So is this where, again,
jumping on the eye bandwagon,
you know, we're looking for
something that's noninvasive,
that you can try and detect.
Can you try and look
at these differences
that might appear in the eye?
And I'm just going
from the associate, the AAO.
It's an association,
there's like four differences
that you can see
in the eye from COVID.
So there's like
cotton wool spots.
There's retinal vein occlusions,
things like that,
that can be looked for.
So maybe just include
some of those.
I don't know if I saw those
in the description here,
but if those can just be
addressed by the committee,
that would be great.
-Avi, do you want
to speak to that?
-Yeah, sure. So I agree.
I think the eye
is the window to the brain,
and the vascularature
is a good place
to look at certainly
in the retina.
But in addition to that,
the other noninvasive ways
of looking at the vasculature,
you know,
one can look at a number
of blood-borne markers,
for example,
B-select and E-select
and VJEF you know,
and some of the MMPs.
So they indicate not only
vascular damage but angiogenesis
that is probably taking place
at the same time.
So they are currently
available in research labs,
but there's no reason why
they couldn't be standardized
and be used more commonly
in patient compilations.
-Thank you.
-Ron, do you want to comment
on that as well?
-No,
I have a different question.
-A different question.
Before we move
to a different question,
I actually wanted
to ask Andrea Troxel to comment
on what's already been collected
and whether there are
any additional systemic tissues
or tissues that could be helpful
to diagnose
this experience
of the biobank and databank.
-Thank you.
So far we are collecting samples
that are preexisting for,
that have been used for
diagnostic or other reasons
and are left over.
So we're sort of up
and running to accept anything.
And I'd actually love to turn
that question back around
to this group
and hear from all of you
if there are
particular kinds of samples
that would inform
this question more directly.
We can certainly reach out
to our sites and let them know
that those are specifically
what we're looking for.
And in terms of data elements,
similarly,
we have a set of common data
elements that we're asking for.
We have a relatively restrictive
set of sort of required elements
so as not to overburden sites
with data entry.
But we have a much wider
set of optional data elements.
And so again, if there are
particular suggestions
that folks have
for what would be most useful.
You know, whether it's related
to this recent, very recent,
very interesting discussion
about the eye issues
or other more general things
that have come up
during the session today.
We'd be very eager to hear
from any of you about that
and try to think about
adding those to our, to our set.
-Sudha, are you trying
to comment on that?
Do you want to comment?
-Yes.
In the neurocognitive
working group of recover,
sensory motor biomarkers
are being refined.
Not on everybody
but particularly on persons
who endure some symptoms.
And this is just
a participant burden issue.
So any comments
are very welcome.
So there are individual studies
that are looking at things like
OCTA as potential markers
of future development
of ADRD-like symptoms.
-Thank you. Ron.
-Yeah, I have a question
for Serena actually.
You mentioned
in passing implications
for clinical trials
in AD and ADRD.
Do you think that trialists
should be taking a history
now of their participants?
Have you been exposed to COVID?
What's the documentation?
And secondarily,
since fluid biomarkers
are being used commonly
and are projected to be used
even more avidly,
going forward for enrollment
in clinical trials,
might the markers
that you have identified
vis-a-vis
COVID exposure alter those,
those biomarkers,
those fluid biomarkers,
and how might we take
that into account?
Simple answer, I'm sure.
-Those are two
fantastic questions.
So for the first one,
you know,
when I was talking
about clinical trials,
I was really going
to kind of outline
some potentially protistic
clinical trials for COVID.
So people who are maybe
having long COVID symptoms,
maybe immune interventions or
sort of vascular interventions,
et cetera.
I do think that this, you know,
has changed the landscape
for all clinical trials
for everything.
And certainly now
when we see patients,
I'm a clinician,
when I see patients
I ask every single patient,
have you had COVID?
Do you know what's
your test results?
When was it?
How severe was your disease?
Were you hospitalized?
That actually goes into I think
a relevant medical history
for pretty much
everybody these days.
And I think related
to clinical trials
and outcomes and interventions
and clinical trials,
that that should be
important and integrated.
I think in terms
of the biomarker changes,
the, for example,
fluid biomarker changes,
the neuronal injury markers,
I think before we know
what long term effects
may be reflected by COVID,
we need more studies.
So for example,
the data that I showed,
very relevant
to the very first comment.
They were all in acute,
hospitalized,
very sick patients.
We have no idea
whether those things
will be persistently abnormal
in people with long COVID,
but that's what
we need to learn.
Because it may be that
that has implications
for subsequent neurogenerative
diagnosis or conditions.
So fantastic questions.
-Good, thank you.
-Thank you, Serena. Gabriel.
-I think he's muted.
-I thought you were muted.
-If I may go back to the
stigma question for a second.
In our long COVID clinic,
we routinely ran, get this off,
a relatively
well-documented profile,
chronic inflammatory markers
in people who continued
to express cognitive
or other physical symptoms,
you know,
chronic fatigue and whatnot.
And we have found
that actually either,
usually two or three
C-reactive protein [Indistinct]
consistently abnormal
in these people.
So that is helpful
in terms of their own,
if you will, recognition
of the state of being ill
and as the documentation
in the chart
that they are not
making up their symptoms.
So I, you know,
they may not be very useful
as long term markers of specific
aspects of the disease,
but they are enough to show
that these people
do have a chronic
inflammatory process
that seems to be affecting them,
their performance.
-Thank you. We're going to
take a couple more questions,
and then we're going
to take a short break.
And just remember that
we have a general session.
So everybody is going to be
able to have an open mike
once we go into that.
So next is Nick Torado.
-Thank you.
It was a really fantastic panel,
so thank you very much.
My question was related
to a fairly common complication
that has been reported
in COVID-19
and also outside of the sphere
about delirium.
And I wanted to hear
from the panel
if there is a way
to disentangle complications
that are raised from delirium
which already connects to AD
and ADRDs versus something
that might just be
very specific to COVID-19.
Thank you.
-Thank you. Nicole wants
to take a crack at that.
-That's a very important point.
Both to disentangle
and, I think,
some of the studies are trying
to get illness controls,
non-COVID illness controls
from the same period of time
or refer to historical controls
like the European study
in Denmark did.
But we may also,
by studying delirium
in the setting of COVID,
learn something
about a condition
we have still inadequate
understanding of,
which is the acceleration
of dementia
after episodes of sepsis.
So you bring up
a very good point.
This is something we need
to carefully address.
The fact that symptoms
are occurring
even in persons
who never go to an ICU
or never have delirium means
that there's probably
different pathologies
perhaps of these subgroups.
Speaking again
to the earlier point
that we shouldn't lump
cognitive impairment after COVID
into only one biological box.
-Thank you so much.
And that delirium
was on my mind
as I was listening both to Avi's
and Serena's presentations
thinking about how do we,
how do we, how do we measure
that pathology, you know?
How do we measure
the cell injury
or perhaps network injury
in vivo as we are monitoring
these patients both in,
you know, with severe illness,
you know, not necessarily,
you know, systemic illness.
And also, those who are
just so easily tipped,
you know, over the, you know,
over the edge with,
you know,
even with mild infection.
So that's something
to think about.
And I'll take the last
question from Helen,
and then we will move
into a break.
And then we will go into
a general session. Helen please.
-Yeah, Dr. Rost,
I just wanted to comment
that I have a daughter
who's an RN
and works
in a large medical center.
And throughout
these last several surges,
they've had infected nurses
on the units
infecting
their fellow coworkers.
And as, as you're
looking at sampling
and access to individuals
who may be available to be
participants in your studies,
I would look to the workforces
that were responding to this.
They include
a broad age range.
We have several that,
you know, yes recovered.
Some that have mild long COVID.
Others that are
profoundly infected.
So that was,
that was the only thing
that I wanted to contribute.
This has been
an extraordinarily in depth
and very, very important
presentation. Thank you.
-Thank you very much.
Anybody from the panel
wants to comment on that
or we just leave it
as an acknowledgement.
Thank you, Helen,
for this comment.
All right, well this was
a fantastic presentation
by this very newly formed
working group,
and I hope this heralds
the many more years of,
you know, exploring this problem
and answering
some very important
questions in the future.
And we wish we didn't
have this problem
starting two years ago,
but we do.
And that only adds to the
complexity of the AD and ADRD.
And I think we are ready
to take it on.
So thank you again everybody.
We're going to have
10 minutes of a break and --
-Can I just, can I, sorry,
can I just say I just want
to really enthuse
for a second about this session
and what we just saw.
And I also want to,
I want to really encourage
everybody to come to the,
to the open session
that Dr. Rost will lead
in a few minutes.
It's an opportunity
to kind of synthesize
with our scientific chair
leading the kind of
input that we've heard
over the course of the meeting,
and this is
a consensus process.
It's the final opportunity at
this meeting to provide input.
So please join us for that
which should be
a very lively discussion.
Thank you.
So the first session yesterday
was health equity in AD/ADRD.
And, and some of the,
of the comments
that I wrote down
during the session include
that the, there's been
a conscious shift,
certainly there's been
a conscious shift over time
to prioritizing health equity.
As well as life course
in the ADRD summit
and in the field in general.
We'll want to follow
people in depth
and get perspective
including about individuals
from diverse backgrounds
and develop tools and materials
that will inform on trajectories
for AD/ADRD in health equity.
And I think, you know,
you see the recommendations
in front of you.
I think a nice way
for this to work
is just to kind of
take a look at them,
and we will open up the floor
to people's final thoughts,
comments and questions
on health equity.
And first up in the queue
we have Michael Ellenbogen.
So Michael.
-Thank you so much.
-Yeah, please, go ahead.
-As you know, ADRD is not high
on the radar
because it's not contagious.
I am also not one
to be an alarmist,
but given what we have learned
in the last year,
should we place ADRD
at a much higher priority
as we don't know
what the outcome will be
because of COVID-19.
We already know that existing
ADRD projectory
can bankrupt this country.
I sure hate to see if COVID
accelerates the process,
what would that likely mean
if we're not prepared?
Thank you.
-Thank you for that comment.
I think that it's very important
for all of us
to continue
to put Alzheimer's disease
and Alzheimer's
disease-related dementia
and related dementias
higher in our priorities.
And we hope this summit
is helping to do that.
Next up in the queue
we have Kathy Service.
-Thank you. Thanks so much.
And I've really been enjoying
this conference
or symposium,
so thank you.
But I'm talking related
to diversity and accessibility,
and I wanted
to remind the group
to remember people
with neuro atypical conditions,
such as
intellectual disabilities,
which includes
Down syndrome.
And I was pleased to see that
mentioned on an earlier slide.
And also people with autism.
Lifelong sensory impairment,
severe mental illnesses
and TBI which you addressed.
I'm a nurse practitioner.
I've worked for over 40 years
with people with
intellectual disabilities.
I'm also on the board
of the National Task Group
for Intellectual Disability
and Dementia Practices.
I'm also a family
supportive volunteer
with the Alzheimer's Association
and Dementia Friends champion
trainer and volunteer.
At our local hospitals, they
have a care ecosystem program,
and I volunteer with
a 90 year old woman
living with dementia
doing some socialization.
But in all these endeavors,
and I'm find that
increasingly more that people
with these atypical conditions
are coming more
and more into our realm.
You know, people living
outside institutions, et cetera.
And all this people
also from this population
have a variety of caretakers,
many of whom provide lifelong
caregiving for people.
And I just wanted
to give you an example
that a local geriatrician asked
me to kind of help out with.
She was asked to assess
a 70 year old man with autism
because his PCP suspected
he may have dementia.
Because this man
had demonstrated
some behavioral stress
in an office visit.
And most the screening tools
we know are inadequate
for these groups of people.
It took me a while
to make an assessment,
and I suspect he might have
had maybe possible MCI,
which has been reported.
As you probably can imagine,
there's really scant
literature on this.
Although there were
a lot of confusing
and confounding
environmental factors.
And I'm not gong
to go on and on,
but I find this, you know,
in one of our dementia
friends trainings
there was a woman with autism
who was wondering about
how to help and support
her husband, et cetera.
So people are out there.
I just also want to bring
to your attention
is that there is a report
that the national task group
that spearheaded
called examining adults
with neurotypical conditions
for MCI
and dementia during cognitive
impairment assessments.
And a report of an expert
consultative panel,
and it's available
on the NTG website.
But you know, when we talk
about diversity,
you know, I rarely see
this population of people,
unless we talk about
Down syndrome
acknowledged and supported.
So I just wanted to make sure
that you don't forget
about this specific group
of people in your endeavors.
So and thanks so much
for listening to me.
-Thank you so much, Kathy.
This is Dr. Rost.
I'm back online.
I really apologize.
We planned for months
for this particular moment,
and I really, I apologize
for the technical problem.
And I would like
if you don't mind
I would like to take
the screensharing capacity.
And I will share
with you my slides.
-Perfect, and welcome back.
-I apologize for that.
So thank God I have
an extra laptop in my office.
And I just wanted to start
with a few very general
comments and observations.
Again, this is the,
this is an endeavor
that's been planned for months
and months and months.
And really, short of
a few technical issues,
you know, this has been
a seamless, you know,
execution by
the entire planning team.
And my special thanks to
the panelists and participants
and the entire NINDS
planning team.
And also to the Infinity Group
for their preparation.
We started with,
you know, trepidations
and how the virtual format for
this summit is going to work.
I can, you know,
assuredly say that now
that it's working quite well.
We really
appreciate participation
from all the registrants.
We started with 1,400
plus registrants
who represented the very wide
spectrum of the,
of the public
nonprofit industry government
and academic
and clinical sectors.
And I have to say
throughout the entire duration
of the summit thus far,
we had an average, you know,
500 attendees
at different times.
And, you know,
anywhere between 300
as we have now at the end
of the second day to 700
at the beginning
of the meeting.
So that's been fantastic.
We had two intense days,
eight scientific sessions,
128 panelists
and 44 individual talks.
So you know,
that's really a great,
you know, a great opportunity
for us to engage.
And thank you to particularly
patients and caregivers.
As I've said before, it's the
voices that keep us honest
and also wanted
to give a shoutout
to the NINDS
Communications Office
for preparing that
very special video presentation
this morning that we've enjoyed.
And thank you to all of you.
I just wanted to share
a few comment things
that I have heard
throughout the sessions.
I've taken notes,
and what I'm looking forward to
is that at the end
of my brief presentation
that all of you will have
an opportunity to jump in
and either, you know,
add, correct or, you know,
or have,
provide different point of view.
I think that we hear that the
great progress has been made,
but more needs to be done.
I hear a very strong voice
of patients and caregivers
and across
the very broad spectrum
of input which I think is much
needed within different topics.
I hear that there is an urgent
need for methods of prevention,
for pre-symptomatic vigilance
so to speak
and also for support of those
who are living with disease.
This is the three areas
that patients and caregivers
specifically
and also the organizations
that advocate
on their behalf have been,
have been communicating with us.
I also hear biomarkers,
biomarkers, biomarkers.
It's, you know, across
all of the topics,
this conversation is, you know,
enriched by the fact that,
you know, biomarkers
at every stage of,
you know, detection, diagnosis,
management, treatment,
response to treatments,
prognosis, all of this I think
in such a complex disease
constellation as AD/ADRD is,
biomarkers are going
to make a difference.
I also hear the theme
of a need for novel models,
new disease biology paradigms.
And going off the beaten path,
so to speak,
seeking synergies
within different diseases
or also maximizing a divergence
in pathological pathways.
And I think this is something
that, you know, all of us,
you know, in the working group
need to go back
and kind of think about
how can we incorporate
that into our recommendations
and make,
and turn them
into milestones.
Then clinical trials have been,
you know, on everybody's mind.
And you know,
there's some diseases
that have terrific progress
already in that directions,
others that need
to move there.
And I think that that's
the voices that we heard.
And then also one
big theme of the need
for resurgent implementation
of pragmatic approaches
and solutions in ADRD.
This is something
that a lot of you
have been commenting on
throughout the summit.
I'm going to go into,
if my slides allow me,
I'm going to go into
topics specific,
comments or themes
that I have captured
as I was listening
to the discussion
following the conversations
within the health
equity discussion.
There was a clear kind
of underscoring of the need
for biomarkers
to understand ADRD
in diverse populations
with dedicated studies
of minoritized populations
covering entire lifespan.
And with special focus
on brain donation that has to,
has to help us advance
understanding of disease
that's specific
to the diverse populations.
There's been a call
for research studies
that go wide and deep
highlighting multiple approaches
that, you know,
that are necessary to solve,
to solve the problems
or give, find the answers.
Breaking the barriers
to recruitment
of diverse populations.
There was a theme of improving
access to clinical trials,
especially to ensure equity.
Making sure that the trials
that are partnered through NIH
are free of cost.
That's a patient's perspective
that we heard.
Gene environment interaction
has been a really big theme
in a discussion following
the health equity session.
Understanding that including
health disparities
related to life course
or life course
of environmental exposures
such as nutrition,
lifestyle, toxicities,
and the need for normal models
like organelles, for example,
to thoroughly account
for the variability
and specifics
of diverse environments.
There was a theme for, of the
need to encourage and expand
by specimen and tissue
collection beyond brain tissue,
including retinal in this case
for discovery
in order to consider
a whole person.
And perspectives
from a caregiver
that we heard
in that particular session
included the transparency
and communication
with caregivers regarding
diagnosis and prognosis.
That them continued
to emerge in different topics.
And I think that
that's something
that each working group
has to,
has to, you know, accommodate
for as we think about,
as we think about
recommendations going forward.
And finally,
a strong foundation
for developing
diverse workforce,
retention and support
of mentors
at all stages
of their career span.
In the FTD group discussion,
biomarkers were front
and center.
Almost every, every comment
had some reference to biomarkers
including particularly pre-
symptomatic neural degeneration,
you know,
with a clinical translation
for current biomarkers
such as NfL being an urgent need
and developing novel ones for
disease progression monitoring,
et cetera.
Innovative clinical markers
including those that capture
social, behavioral and movement,
you know, metrics
that may help make,
you know, participation
and research
as well as perhaps
further translation
of the recent research
findings into care
and make those accessible.
And also developing novel
endpoints that capture the broad
spectrum of clinical disease.
So that's something
that was very,
very robust
in terms of discussion.
Also within the FTD session
discussion,
there was a lot of focus
on prevention
and the need to assist those
who are living with FTD.
And I think that that's
a very strong patient
as well as
a caretaker perspective.
A risk and resilience
factor characterization
came into discussion
and also continued to be a theme
throughout the rest
of the summit.
Quantitative data
was highlighted,
the need for quantitative data
was highlighted.
Not only the all mix level
but the level of protein biology
and other precision methods
of molecular characterization
of disease.
And then from
the patient perspective,
the question of, you know,
delayed diagnosis,
is the detection
delayed diagnosis.
And reconsideration of this
kind of single diagnosis
box that patients are frequently
dealing with in real world.
For VCID session,
there was a very robust
scientific discussion
that followed presentation.
And there were certainly
VCID has been identified
as one of the areas
of clear intersection of science
and, you know, emerging need
to explore novel pathways
and also finetuning
the existing models.
VCID is dementia
and sleep intersection
was used as an example of kind
of evolving
understanding
of the disease with,
you know, moving
from the concepts
of ischemic models of disease
into understanding the
mechanisms of clearance that,
you know, may have
that novel pivot
in our understanding
of disease.
And as a result,
developing novel
approaches to
nonischemic mechanisms,
for example,
in this particular area
including
the impaired clearance.
There was a very robust
and also I think fascinating
discussion with regard
to the nuances of how
we approach modeling of ischemia
and in general VCID
considering the diversity
in cell types
that we are,
you know, increasingly
understand original blood
flows in the brain,
vascular reactivity,
et cetera, et cetera.
All of the foundations
of the VCID disease
processes as we know
them right now.
But with a broadening
so to speak spectrum
and portfolio of understanding
of these nuances
I think is something
that we need to think
on how that may enhance our
recommendations going forward.
And also, big focus
on reproducibility,
repeatability of models
at every stage
including design,
data collection, data sharing.
Understanding VCID
is a systemic disease
and the role in that
of circulating biomarkers.
Obviously,
this I something that,
you know, being done currently,
but there are perhaps
opportunities for novel
approaches
and emerging,
using emerging systemic
circulating biomarkers
as well as
imaging technologies.
And I just wanted
to quote Dr. Seshadri's,
I think kind of a statement
which kind of culminated
this discussion of VCID
is that perhaps the science or
our approach to science in VCID
is going to, you know,
through increasing complexity
until we arrive
at some simplicity.
And I think that that may be,
may be the thing here as well.
In LBD, group discussion,
I think that the big things
were sharing of information
across the disease entities
considering how heterogeneous
and also perhaps
in some areas overlapping,
you know, disease pathology
clinical,
clinical syndromes
that we are dealing with.
Making sure that the dialogue
is accessible for the public
in conveying
the complexity of disease.
The patient kind of a guidance
to us with regard
to access to clinical trials
across the spectrum of LBD,
especially as diagnostic
precision evolves and patients
seek new opportunities
as their diagnosis
of which is actually a theme
that came up
in at least a couple of sessions
throughout the summit.
Which I thought was very,
very curious.
Biomarkers were front
and center with LBD as well.
Pre-symptomatic, pre-clinical
diagnostic prognostic,
all of these have been
on the mind of our scientists
as well as patients
and families and care partners.
Focus on disease heterogeneities
also led to a discussion
of both clinical
and precision characterization.
Moving away from silos and again
clearer communications.
And then developing
opportunities for disease
modification
and symptom control of patients
who are already living with LBDs
is something that, again,
was reverberated
in the discussion session
following this.
Now this morning we had
a very robust discussion
following the mixed etiology
dementia session.
It was an outstanding session.
And I think there was
quite a bit of caregiver
and patient perspective
that was introduced in the,
in the discussion there.
The need for engagement across
the entire spectrum of disease
and transparency
in communication
was underlined
multiple times.
Opportunities to impact
care and engagement
via a compassionate and
culturally appropriate detection
and diagnosis process.
So this is something that I
wanted to personally thank
for this feedback
from our participants.
And I think that
this is duly noted
by the members
of the MED working group
but as well as our entire,
entire community.
There was a note
of consideration of provider
burden and wellbeing,
which obviously contributes
in some sort of either
positive perpetuating cycle
or perhaps an ambitious
cycle on the other,
on the other side
of the equation
where we need to ensure that
the providers remain engaged
and well in being able
to provide the needed compassion
for the patients
and families.
I also enjoyed
the discussion on research
that's needed
on cultural aspects
of risk and benefit perception
and potentially policy research
into economic impact
of screening and early detection
of cognitive impairment
and dementia
on diverse populations.
I think it's
a very important
and potentially
very impactful area
that we may need to address.
We also had opportunities to,
or discussed opportunities
to amplify effectiveness
of multiple
approaches via harmonization
between MED and VCID topics.
And then also, the important
care partners input from,
that we again restated
from both, from the beginning,
from the research concept
from one side of the spectrum
to execution of research,
and this input is needed.
There were a few important
points in post-TBI,
AD and ADRD session
that I have captured,
and one of them is central
role of biomarkers in diagnosis
that has been discussed with
a great degree of robustness.
In the face of
clinical heterogeneity
of post-TBI ADRD syndromes,
I think the panel
has ultimately arrived
at a conclusion
that biomarkers in this,
in this role, would provide
probably a greater degree
of fidelity of diagnosis.
There was also
a very robust discussion
of post-TBI ADRD versus CTE,
chronic traumatic
encephalopathy,
where the acknowledgement
was made that the study design,
include specifics of exposure
history and biomarker arrays
are needed to differentiate
between the impact
of acute
versus chronic injury.
There was also point discuss
regarding standardization
and prioritization
of translational models.
A note has been made
of a great existing history
of TBI models prior
and also ongoing work done
by Veterans Administration
Department of Defense
in collaboration
with NIH, both NIA and NIDS,
and these collaborations
perhaps are best to be maximized
on as the models of post-TBI,
AD and ADRD are being developed.
And then of course a very
important patient perspective
that was proposed
into this discussion
with regard to availability
and accessibility of public
facing education in this area.
I made also a few notes
with regard to our late session.
The discussion was also robust,
and I think the emerging themes
were that there's a need
for harmonization of data
and sample collection.
And you know, using this
in order to benefit other fields
related within the ADRD
but also perhaps
neurological disorders
or brain disorders
outside of ADRD as well.
There was a discussion on VCID
and late interface,
particularly with
a good proportion of,
you know, nonagenarians or
late octogenarians who survive
and are diagnosed
with late disorder or syndrome.
I should say they also have
a high predominance
of cerebral vascular findings
and exploring
or exploiting
this opportunity
to study coexistence
of this type of pathology,
neuropathology offers
great opportunities to address
some of the, you know,
evolving pathophysiology.
And in this context,
the role of perivascular spaces
and, you know,
clearance in the brain,
proteinopathies, you know,
in the brain was addressed
as well as opportunities
to study
let's say impact
of chronic sleep disorders
in this patient population.
There was also a discussion
on clinical diagnosis readiness,
including biomarkers,
clinical criteria
that are needed to validate
prospectively the diagnosis
and to give options
for patients and families.
And I think while the jury
is still out on
where is the risk and benefit
ratio stands with regard
to whether we want
to quote/unquote rush in
in providing a diagnosis
to a patient
or whether
we should step back
until we are actually able
to provide something that,
you know, the diagnosis
that not only,
you know, not only a preliminary
but also actionable.
I think that's the sort
of a discussion
that we will continue
to have over
the, you know,
over the next few years.
And I'll be very interested
to see how much progress
we will make in this space
in the next three years.
Because it clearly in the prior
three years, you know,
since the LATE has been
introduced TDP
for the three topic has been
introduced in this context,
so much progress
has been already established.
And we finished off
with a COVID session
which, you know is just
very fresh in our memory.
And due to my technical errors,
I have not been able to update
my slides very thoroughly.
But what I heard
in our discussion,
which was a fantastic
discussion,
and I thank all the panelists,
is that, you know,
data sharing is something
that is urgently needed.
You know, data harmonization,
syndrome characterizations
and, you know,
focusing on detection,
you know, of the COVID-19
exposures in patients
not only with severe diseases
but obviously those who
experienced even mild infections
or perhaps asymptomatic
is needed
and how to translate
these concepts
into future clinical trials
is something that we're going
to have focus on,
you know, for the duration
of the, you know,
of the next study period
so to speak for this group.
So I'm going to end here,
and I will offer everybody
a forum for the,
for the comments both on
the general comments that I made
but also anything else
in the context of the summit
that you can offer.
And Hector, I see you --
-Well I think
there was a question
that was being asked
of Dr. Carlson
when the transition
between you and me occurred.
Is that right?
-I just wanted,
this is Cindy Carlsson,
so I just want to address
Kathy Service thank you
for your comments
about thinking about people
with neurotypical symptoms
and people who have intellectual
disability and Down syndrome.
Because again,
I think your comment
that we need
to better understand
what their baseline is.
Make sure we're doing a good job
of including them in studies
but also making sure
that we are training clinicians
to really get a good sense
of people's baseline.
So that's an extremely
important point.
I want to apply the work
of national task group
that's been working so hard
in developing toolkits
for people to help
with this training.
And we had addressed
this at the last NAPA meeting
because it's such
an important issue.
So thank you
for brining that up.
I think that'll have
a lot of implications
for the early detection group
so that we can make we get
a good baseline on people
whether it be different
educational backgrounds,
neurotypical symptoms,
et cetera.
So thank you for bringing
that comment up
and for your work
with the group.
-Sorry, Natalia,
please carry on.
-No worries.
Thank you, Dr. Carlsson.
Apologies, I jumped
right in the middle
of your initial discussion.
Hector, you had your hand up.
-Yeah, thank you, Natalia.
And I want to share
your thanks to the organizers
for doing a splendid job on
bringing us all together here.
Thank you very much on behalf
of the health equities panel.
Just a quick comment.
Something that I observed
from the 2016 to the 2019
to the now 2022 ADRD summits
is just this elevation
if you will,
the recognition of the
importance of inclusive research
in Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias
that what I heard over
the last couple of days
was that health equity
was mentioned and acknowledged.
And the LTN to each of
the different panels
and to my fellow panelists
I want to say
thank you for this recognition
and also to NINDS
for elevating the importance
of an inclusive research field
of Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias.
Thanks again.
-You're exactly right, Hector.
And thank you
and Dr. Zissimopoulos
for leading the effort
with your working group.
I believe next comment
is by Elaine Swift.
-Yes, thank you.
And I wanted to echo
Dr. Gonzalez's comments
on just the importance of equity
and how gratifying it
is to see it front and center
at this terrific conference.
I was also happy
to see the recognition,
especially in recommendation
eight on the importance of data
infrastructure to research these
very complicated conditions
over long periods of time
and to do it in a way
that advances equity.
And I certainly, you know,
in that regard,
of casting a broad net
over the data infrastructure,
I'd like to underscore
the importance
of the HR data
infrastructure.
And this will require attention
to building a far more robust
and interoperable data
infrastructure as, for example,
is being done
in NDS's long-running work
on comma data elements.
But I'd also like
to call attention
to the M-code initiative
for EHR data
that is working to
standardize data on oncology,
to diversify clinical trials,
to support precision medicine,
all of those good things.
And as it's being done
for cancer,
it could also be done
for AD/ADRD.
Constance Lyketsos,
Howard Fillit, Diane Bovenkamp,
Ian Kramer
and MITRE researchers.
I'm Elaine Swift.
I'm from MITRE.
We have an article
coming out on NJ pad,
on how we could leverage
and an M-code approach for ADRD.
And by casting a broad net
for EHR data.
It's, of course, an extremely
important way to diversify
the patients who are
involved in research
or prevention or treatment,
who are surveilled
when new treatments come out.
Just a key approach that
I'd like to call attention to.
Thank you.
-Thank you very much.
Thank you, Elaine.
Next --
-I'll just comment,
thank you, Elaine.
I'll bring this back
to the MED committee
so we can think about
how to incorporate
that into our
harmonization recommendation.
Thank you for that point.
-Thank you.
-And Elaine, I think
your paper
just came out
the other day actually.
I was just reading it.
-I, I actually,
it's not quite out yet.
It's, but it should be shortly.
-Okay.
-You might have seen a copy
from a colleague, though.
Thank you.
-Thank you for your comment.
I think next question in Q
and A is Nancy Smith.
-Thank you very much.
This has really been
an exceptional two days.
I can only call it
scientific speed dating.
It's just been great.
My comment is relative
to the health equity
recommendation number one,
and it comes from
a study-specific perspective.
As many of you may be aware,
NIA has funded
two rounds
of our 24 projects
focused on examining
different approaches
to diversity recruitment
and retention and aging,
some 20 in total
over the past three, four years.
I've been involved in one,
involved in Mount Sinai
and SUNY
Upstate Medical University
focused on cognitive research
in African Americans.
And despite,
we have annual meetings,
of course, of all those
that are funded.
And despite the wide variety
and the focus
and approaches in populations,
there's three very key themes
from the institutional level
that have come up.
And one is it takes time
to build
and gain the community trust
to even begin to think
about diversifying participation
and research.
But equally important,
it requires changes
to the research designs
and recruitment methods
that traditionally are either
excluded or discouraged
or just don't address
the interest
in the situations
of diverse populations.
And that both of these
require changes
in the research infrastructure
at the study level
and the institutional level.
And that takes time,
requires more resources,
and it has financial
implications.
So my comment is that
I definitely support the concept
of establishing recruitment
and retention centers.
But I hope also
that we can talk about
how NIH funding
has got to be acknowledged.
That to do this work
really right,
it's going to take more time,
more resources and more finances
at the study level.
And that's my comment.
-Thank you, Nancy.
Does anybody want
to provide feedback?
-Nancy, I'll take a shot.
Thank you very much
for your comments,
and I appreciate
what you're saying,
and the nuances
of what your --
implications
of what you're saying
is that it's going to take time.
It's going to take
some infrastructure-building,
and I think what I see is,
over the last two decades
I've been doing this work,
is just how, I guess,
far behind we are in working
with diverse communities,
and the need to really build
it out from the ground up.
There is some existing
material infrastructure,
but you're absolutely right.
Your point's well-taken,
and thank you very much
for your comment.
-Susan Dickinson?
-Thanks, Dr. Rost.
I appreciate it.
You can hear me okay?
-Yes.
-Great. I want to thank you
and all the subcommittee chairs.
It has been so energizing to see
how much progress we've made
since we last convened
three years ago,
and I applaud everybody in
setting such an ambitious path
for the next three years.
I did also want
to thank Dr. Carlson
and other members
of the NAPA Council,
who meet year-round, and do
so much to provide leadership
to the whole initiative
nationally,
and to make sure that we're
ensuring we meet the milestones
that we set each year
at these different summits.
I want to make just one comment,
and ask a question, if I may.
During this morning's multiple
etiology dementia session,
we heard Ian Kremmer weigh in
with the importance
of making sure that diagnosis
becomes more accurate,
more timely, more compassionate,
and more actionable.
And I just wanted
to make a comment on that --
the point of compassion.
And the other thing I'd say
is this relates
to a lot of the points
that you included,
Dr. Rost, in your summary,
which is how many times
the importance of having clarity
in communication
has come through
in each of these sessions.
One of the results
of the last summit in 2019
was the dementia
nomenclature initiative,
which both Ron Peterson
and Angela Taylor
mentioned yesterday.
Over the past three years,
they've led groups,
including scientists,
and clinicians,
and public stakeholders,
to really look at how we are --
the nomenclature we use,
the whole communication
framework we use
in talking
about these diseases
can be more accurate,
can be more clear.
Which I would argue
equals more compassionate,
when the end result, you know,
happens in the exam room,
where some --
a family's getting a diagnosis,
or the family has
to then go home,
and then figure out
what it means,
and how they're going
to cope with it.
And I just wanted to put a plug
for how important
this new communication framework
they are suggesting is,
and to encourage everybody
to become familiar with it,
and do whatever you can
to help the initiative advance.
I think we're all
in this business
to help people
on this journey,
until we have a cure
or some kind of prevention.
I think the best
we can hope to do
while we advance
the science is
to help people maintain
their quality of life,
and have as easy a journey
on the path as they can.
And my question
relates to the fact
that I've been part of all of
these summits since 2013,
and we get more ambitious
every year, which is wonderful.
But we've expanded from
five sessions to eight by now,
and I was wondering
if somebody can just speak
to how we're going to ensure
that there are robust resources
dedicated to --
that are going to enable us
to meet the milestones
for all eight of these sets
of wonderful recommendations?
I think they're all important.
I think they're all ambitious,
and I think they all deserve
to be invested in,
but we all know, you know,
there are limited resources.
So I don't know who might
be able to speak to that.
-Well, I'll reach out
to the panelists.
Rod, do you want
to speak to that?
-I think Walter unmuted.
-Yeah, Susan, I think you
point to the bigger picture,
which is, as you really look
at these issues in total,
it's -- you're looking at
an entire ocean of problems.
So I think the strategy is
to not leave a stone unturned,
but focus on what looks like
it's going to move most quickly
to a solution
that's going to help people.
I think it's that balance.
I think, you know, if it hadn't
been for the increased funding
that's come from Congress,
it would just be --
it would be very depressing
to have these kind of
conversations.
But I'm very optimistic
that the funding
is really quite good now,
and that there's actually
another increase in this budget.
So I think our real bottleneck
is actually building
the workforce,
and --
but the good news there is,
the funding is permanent
going forward, on the base of --
and we manage about 10%
of that funding for the ADRDs.
But as --
because it is permanent,
I think that gives us
the opportunity to look --
not just be disappointed
at how big the problems are,
but to realize that we can
actually -- over time, work --
can take on a large number
of these problems.
So I'm pretty optimistic.
Compared to the other diseases
in my portfolio,
I'm much more optimistic here,
in terms of the resources.
I think we should all be.
I mean, we're in
a really good spot,
something really,
really impactful.
I think we're getting
really close.
So if we can cure one
by the next time we meet,
I'll be very happy,
but we got to get a cure.
-Thank you, Walter.
Tony, you had your hand up.
I'll let you speak right now.
Tony Antonucci?
-Thank you.
I'm a little --
this comment was --
back goes to something
we were discussing earlier.
I think -- but Walter mentioned
we really need the workforce,
so I think I'd like
to reiterate that.
In our comments,
the first group,
we talked about training
for a diverse workforce.
That's critical, but it's not
unrelated to the issue
of engaging a population willing
to participate in research.
And that's not secondary.
That's very primary, and it
takes a lot of investment.
In a couple of other areas
that I work in,
we have years of investment
in the community,
working with community members,
working with community advisory
boards to build up trust.
I mean, there's really
no other way to put it,
and in this case,
we have the issue
of ethnic minority distrust,
which, unfortunately,
is well-earned.
And secondly, we have
the whole stigma attached
to this kind
of an illness, ADRD.
People don't want to admit it
under any circumstances,
but especially
under circumstances
where they don't trust
the people talking
to them about it,
or inviting them
to participate.
So I think a real concerted
effort needs to be invested,
both in the workforce and in
developing a relationship
with the community
that we want to work with,
and in finding a way
to give back.
Because we can't
just helicopter in,
do our study,
and helicopter out.
That's all I wanted to say.
-Good point.
Anybody wants
to further comment,
or provide anything back?
I think everybody agrees, Tony.
I think that's
the consensus here.
I'd like to try to --
-It takes time and money.
I mean, you can't just
do it with one shot.
I mean, there's one group I work
with that's had 20 years
of developing relationship
with the community,
another group that's
going on four or five.
And it's still slow going.
So I think we,
as researchers and NIH
as funders need to recognize
just how long-term
a commitment this must be.
Sorry.
-Cindy, do you want
to comment on that?
-Yes, just that, again,
I support what Tony's saying.
I think that, from what we're
hearing from our black leaders
for brain health,
and here in Madison,
Wisconsin is that
they are saying
we need to have
investigators of color
who are out there
doing the work,
and that's going to bring
people into the studies,
and have diverse
representation.
So, again, that -- just that
emphasis that has to be,
first and foremost,
a training that has mentioned,
so that we can get
that diverse workforce,
and then the representation
in studies will follow.
Thank you.
-And, Ron, were you
following on that same?
-Just a comment, thank Susan
for mentioning
the nomenclature initiative.
And that's one of the goals
of the nomenclature initiative,
to bring some consistency
of language
across different stakeholders,
from the public,
to the clinicians,
to the scientists,
and in particular
with regard to diversity.
I think we're
getting feedback
from a lot of the
underrepresented groups
that the language, the words
are getting in the way
with regard to understanding
their particular condition
and participation
in research.
So I think that the framework
that has been developed
in phase one of
the nomenclature initiative
will help in that direction,
and now we have to move it out
into a general acceptance,
in terms of utilization.
So we'll be presenting to Cindy
and the advisory council
on the first of May
with our findings.
-Perfect, thank you.
I'm going to try to bring
back Ms. Carolyn Rogers,
who's been trying to talk
to us for a while.
Michelle, do we have
Carolyn with us?
-We did. I think
she actually has departed.
-Well, I'm really sorry
to hear that.
She's been trying to make
a point with regard to,
you know, root causes
of mixed dementia pathology,
and I think that
she made a comment
in one of the either
MED sessions,
or late sessions,
and I think that
that's something
that we could not
get to that time.
And I'm really sorry she hasn't
had a chance to stay with us,
to answer.
But I think we all agree,
this is what this work
is all about.
Okay, I have Sonya Valab
next on the -- online.
-Hi.
Thank you so much for making
the time for me to speak.
So I'll quickly
introduce myself first.
So I'm Sonya Valab.
I run a prion lab at the Brode
Institute in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, where we work
on drug develop,
biomarker development,
natural history,
et cetera,
for prion disease,
which as you all know
is a rapidly-progressive,
currently untreatable
dementia.
I'm also at risk myself
for genetic prion disease,
so I inherited
a fatal mutation
in the prion protein gene
from my mom,
who died of genetic
prion disease in 2010.
So I've been on the patient side
and on the caregiver side
of this disease,
as well as having,
inspired by that experience
to get into the research side.
So all of that
is a preface to say
that I really just have a
targeted plea for the committee.
Thank you for
all of the great work
that you're doing on Alzheimer's
and related dementias,
and I just want to raise
for consideration
the possibility that
prion disease could be named
among the Alzheimer's
disease-related dementias.
I think, mechanistically,
we've seen over the past
few years
a real sort of dovetailing
of some of the insights
in the prion field
that have sort of come out
of propagated prion misfolding,
including diagnostic assays
that leverage the sort
of prion concept,
but now have been
applied more broadly
to other neurodegenerative
diseases,
in which we see templated
protein misfolding.
And on the flip side,
for example,
much of the biomarker work
and need for better biomarkers
that was discussed earlier
this afternoon
and in these past two days
certainly has enriched our work,
as we look for many of
the same biomarkers
in our natural history work.
On the theme of prevention
and pre-symptomatic vigilance,
this is an area where we
have really tried to advocate --
you know, myself
as a healthy carrier myself --
for novel biomarker-based
and genetically-informed
clinical trial models,
and I think there could be
shared learnings
across these diseases.
So with that, I'll just say
I think very much hearing
the themes
that have been touched on,
I think we feel a kinship
with this community,
and see a lot of
research questions, tools,
and needs that are shared
across these domains.
So I would love
for prion disease
to be considered
among the list of diseases.
Thanks so much.
-Thank you, Sonya.
-I wonder if Ryan wants
to go near this one.
We've discussed
this multiple times, Sonya,
and from what
we can figure out,
it would take somebody to go
to Congress to change it.
Now, it's not impossible,
so you should think about it,
but Congress, we understand,
made this determination,
and these are the ones --
these three are the only ones.
Everything else has got
to be somehow related.
Ron, is that --
-Yeah, thanks for throwing
the ball to me, Walter.
-Oh, I'm sorry.
You don't have to --
-No --
-I have other dementing diseases
in our portfolio,
like Huntington's for instance,
and it's not allowed.
-No, we've had extensive
discussions about this,
going back to day one of
the NAPA Advisory Council,
as to what's in and out.
And to be honest,
in fairness to Congress,
if I may, I think
they were just talking
about Alzheimer's disease,
and then in the --
in writing the legislation,
said, well, don't we mean other
dementing disorders as well?
Yeah, of course we do.
And then they listed
the common ones.
You know, I think
that's really what happened.
You know, the legislation,
if it's going
to be reauthorized,
will happen not tomorrow,
but in 2025,
and certainly all of
these considerations
need to be included.
But we need to get
on prion disorders before 2025,
so I understand
your urgency, Sonya.
-Thank you, and Ron,
if you want to address this.
-Yeah, that's --
thank you for your input, Sonya,
and I wanted to add --
to mention that
while prion diseases
aren't right now official AD,
ADRD disorders
under the national plan,
the National Institute of Health
does recognize the relevance,
inasmuch as when there are
prion research is proposed,
and it's also very relevant
for Alzheimer's disease
and Alzheimer's disease-related
dementias research,
that also gets
special consideration.
So acknowledging that
it's not explicitly named,
I also want to assure you that
the relevance is not lost to us,
and that we definitely --
that type of research
is included
under the special pay lines
when it's relevant to AD, ADRD.
Thank you.
-Thank you.
-And Cindy?
-And again, Sonya,
thank you for your comments.
I think another venue
would be for you to present
and make some public comments
also at the NAPA meeting.
So again, trying to bring that
to people's attention,
and I'll carry that
to the groups as well,
to think about these other,
less common,
but just as important,
diseases that maybe should work
their way
into the national plan.
Thank you.
-Thank you.
-Thank you,
and thank you, Sonya.
Thank you for your comments.
Our next question --
we are rapidly coming
to an end of an hour.
Penny, are you on?
Yes, fair.
-Thank you, Dr. Rost, yeah.
So my comment's
going to intersect a little bit
with the one
from Nancy Smith earlier,
so my apologies for that.
But it's for the health
equity committee to consider
that when we think
about the emerging trends
in research and policy,
I think we're all going
to be learning
how those trends
are going to be
affecting the comfort level
of participation
from people of distinct
socioeconomic, regional,
and ethnocultural backgrounds.
And I think a centralized group
that tries to help us
understand and anticipate
that could be really valuable
for all of us,
and I'm thinking about things
like open data
and open sharing,
open science,
knowing that
different groups of folks
have very different
trust levels
with what's going
to happen to their data,
and who's sharing it,
who's buying it,
who's selling it, as well as
on the digital biomarkers.
A lot of the individual sessions
talked about the importance
of digital biomarkers
and digital assessment tools
to transform clinical research.
Many of us are very hopeful
that it's going
to improve inclusivity
and improve power
for clinical research
by having more
frequent measurements
within people's homes of
individual measure of function.
But the comfort levels
of people from distinct cultures
with having those measurements
taken, where you have devices
monitoring their activity
at the home,
I think is something we haven't
fully understood yet.
And I think it's something
we're all going to be dealing
with separately
when the clinical trials
are active for FTD,
for Alzheimer's,
for vascular dementia.
I think we're all going
to be realizing
that the decisions we make
around research design,
and the policy,
and what happens to the data
is going to affect the
comfort level of participants.
So the more that we have
some centralized learnings
of community and cultural
differences, and comfort level,
and how our choices
will affect that,
the more I think all
of our fields can move forward
to really implement
the technology that we need.
-Great comment, Penny.
Anybody wants to provide
feedback,
particular from the health
equity group?
-Think it was
more of a statement,
rather than a question, Penny.
I think everybody's uniformly
supporting your standpoint here,
and I think it's duly noted.
Thank you.
Thank you for your input
throughout the entire summit,
actually.
It was very helpful.
Right, our last --
yeah, go ahead.
-Oh, sorry.
Ms. Dax,
thanks for your comments,
and I think I share
some of your concerns
about how some communities
may be a bit more concerned
about some of these
monitoring devices if you will.
And I think your comment
about a centralized
or some kind
of open-source availability
of best practices
recommendations,
if I'm hearing
what you've said correctly,
is a brilliant idea.
And I think that science
of inclusion
should take note
of what you just pointed out.
So, thank you.
-Thank you, hector.
And very appropriately,
we have our last panelist,
Mr. Dale Listina, to provide --
to ask his question,
or provide his final comments.
Dale, are you with us?
-Yes, I am.
Thank you, Natalia.
-Sure.
-Let me congratulate you
on the excellent summary of --
that you gave.
You have a gift,
to be able to listen
to all these presentations
and to summarize them
like you did.
Please accept
my congratulations.
I would like to speak
to the first session
of this morning, MED,
which Kate Poston
was the leader.
And commented about the video
that you opened up with,
and I will not go
over my comments.
I still stand by them,
but I have a post-script, Kate.
And that is that --
well, I talked about insight
here in northern Virginia,
and the things that they do.
I want to add another thing,
and that --
we're talking about
community involvement,
and community understanding.
They are experimenting
with enlightening
the community itself
about dementia,
and I have an example.
I took --
my wife used to go along
with me to the grocery store,
and in the process of doing it,
all of a sudden,
she didn't recognize me anymore,
and she thought I was somebody
trying to kidnap her.
And she let the folks
in the store
rather loudly know about that.
The manager of the store
knew that --
about this kind of thing,
although I didn't know him,
and separated us.
He had staff stay with my wife,
and it took about an hour,
hour and a half.
And things settled down,
and the understanding
of that manager and his staff --
it was no small store.
It was Wegman's.
You know, that's a pretty
good-sized store,
and they handled the situation
very, very well.
And so, I would like to add
to the recommendations,
if, indeed, Kate,
and your group is
going to look into that group,
which I absolutely recommend
to you to do,
is to look
at their experimentation
of dealing with local doctors,
and with local restaurants,
and so forth,
for people to understand
what dementia is,
and what it is like,
and to be a bit more sympathetic
as to what's happening,
and cooperative in dealing
with the situation.
That's my comment.
I thank you all very much.
This has, as usual,
been an excellent,
excellent couple sessions,
and I thank you very much.
-Thank you, Mr. Listina.
Your comments have been
really important
throughout this session,
and they are going to shape,
I think, our recommendations.
Thank you for
bringing your voice,
and closing with this
really important point,
that I think is not
well-represented
in the recommendations
right now.
So I will also bring this point
back to the MED committee,
so we can think about
how we can advance awareness
around dementia
in a compassionate with,
with providers,
people in business,
and the broader society.
So, thank you for that
really important comment.
-Thank you very much, Kate.
I have one last thing.
We have as a goal to cure
some dementia by 2025.
Walter had mentioned this
in the opening of the session.
By 2025, to cure a dementia,
to cure one.
I would invite, if you would,
prognosticate with me.
Which one is the best candidate
for that to happen?
-Who is brave on this panel?
-Maybe it's a rhetorical
question,
but nevertheless,
it's coming up --
whoa, I see Walter is going
to give it a shot. Go ahead.
-I was going to ask
David Holzcomb.
I mean, you don't put
your money down
until you know
who's going to win,
but there's a couple horses
in the field here.
We'll see.
Certainly, the anti-amyloid
therapy of Alzheimer's,
going to get answers
pretty quickly
whether that's effective,
and that, you know --
that's a kind of foot
in the door.
But I would just say
it's somewhat more exciting
now than 50 years ago,
when we really
didn't know anything
about what we were doing.
So, David, would you want
to take a shot at --
I mean, there's so many
different opportunities,
it's hard to pick one.
-I don't know which --
I certainly --
none of us know
which one might be first,
but I think actually Sonya,
who was speaking about
genetic prion disease --
I mean, I think
some of the genetic
neurodegenerative diseases,
where lowering the level
of the gene and protein
in animals really can prevent
or very much delay the disease,
I think, are the most amenable
to the earliest big effect,
like with the SMA
as a various specific example
that is pretty much curable now.
But that --
I wouldn't necessarily call it
a neurodegenerative disease,
but it's close.
But I think something where
you could knock the protein down
to have a big impact is probably
the best first candidate.
-I -- again, Walter,
you said a while ago,
just in this particular session,
that the demand
on these sessions,
and the size of the scope
is getting bigger,
and bigger, and bigger.
And I would say yes,
this is a very big problem.
And it will get bigger,
but I implore all of us --
don't give up because
it's getting bigger.
It's getting bigger because
the need is getting bigger,
and just hang in there.
I'll do my best on my end,
and I know you will, too.
And that's --
we've just got to do it.
We cannot give up.
Thank you.
-I cannot think of better
closing remarks
for this session,
putting into perspective
not only the humanity
of the work that so many do,
some in a laboratory,
some in clinic,
and some in providing care
to patients with,
you know, this terrible disease.
So humanity, purpose, passion --
I think all of that
has been inspiring,
you know, throughout
these two days,
and I think we have our work
cut out for us going forward.
And there's some
immediate steps to do.
You know, we'll work
on the recommendations,
and put the reports forward,
but I think there's also
some long-term work to do.
And I promise you, Mr. Listina,
we're not going to give up.
That's just the only thing
I can say,
and I think we're in
our closing comments session.
At this point, Walter,
if there's anything you want
to say to wrap the session up --
you're on mute.
-I think you did a fantastic job
going through the details,
presentations,
and please send me
those slides.
Because we're going to go in
through all the recommendations
in detail, too,
so it's very helpful.
You know, I just --
just in closing,
say that,
as I referred to earlier,
you know, some of the people
have been in this field
for 30 or 40 years,
look back,
and, you know, how do we think
about this 30 or 40 years ago?
And just, like,
what were you thinking?
Really it's such a much more
sophisticated place now.
The problems are bigger also,
because we know more
about the complexity,
not as simple
as we initially thought.
But there's so many potential
targets that have appeared,
and takes persistence
and a little bit of luck.
But we're dealing with things
that are really inherent
to the diseases now.
So I think
we can feel comfortable
that these efforts --
you know, you can't say which
one is going to bear fruit,
but I would put a lot of money
that one of them is,
just because there's so much
going on in the field.
There's industry involvement
now we didn't have before.
So I think we're entering
a pretty exciting period.
There are a lot that we know,
and we talked about
some of those today,
the heterogeneity,
the different topologies,
the different molecules
that are involved,
the interactions between
the different pathologies.
Talking about brain health,
which, you know,
is something that we know.
If we had a way of, you know,
enticing people to think
about brain health
in the early midlife,
that this could have
a major impact
on decreasing the chance
of dementia in,
you know, 30
or 40 years later in their life.
We do know that, you know,
Alzheimer's disease modification
is potentially there.
We don't know for sure yet,
but there is some enticing data
that the anti-amyloid therapies
may actually have
mental benefit.
We'll have to wait and see,
but they're very powerful
at taking amyloid
out of the brain,
no question about that.
That's pretty amazing.
Then there's a lot
of known unknowns.
So we know a lot
about the genetic drivers,
but we don't know exactly how
to move those -- that knowledge.
We know that the mutations
manipulate the system
to cause disease.
Now, what we have
to figure out is,
how do we compensate
or prevent that from happening,
so that we end up
with a treatment
based on what we know
out of the genetics?
I think that's
low-hanging fruit.
The second one, which is harder,
but is actually surprisingly --
some of the FTDs,
been very interesting,
where something we find out form
the genetics turns out to be,
you know --
and all the sporadics as well.
So TDD43 story's a good one,
and all the ALS cases,
a lot of the other dementias
as well.
So there are these things
that -- where you don't --
we know what they are.
We know what we don't know,
and we have a path forward
that we think,
you know, will get us
the answers in the end.
So we call it
the known unknowns.
Then, there is the issue
of the unknown unknowns,
and that's usually the scariest
part of the business,
where you think you know
what the problem is.
Spend 10 years,
and it doesn't work,
and you realize,
well,
I made some assumptions
that were wrong.
I didn't know X, Y, or Z, and
that's led to the final failure.
So you always have to think
that, you know, as a community,
we tend to want to look
under the lamp post,
and that's what we know.
That's the known unknowns, but
we've got to be really careful.
There's something out there
beyond the lamp post
that's really relevant
to what we need to do.
And so, that's, I think,
keeping your eye out for things
that are going on
in other areas of biology --
cancer, you know,
basic molecular biology.
Sometimes that's where the real
breakthroughs come from,
and so, I think that's how
I look at the picture we have,
where we are now.
The recommendations
that were put together here,
I think, are, you know,
very well thought-out,
and we can work with those,
and make progress.
It's not going to be easy,
but I think, you know,
with the workforce dedication
and the funding that's now
available through NAPA,
we can really make progress.
So I'm very optimistic,
and a lot of the optimism
is because the last two days,
the people that have, you know,
shown their passion
and dedication for this field.
I think we have a good team.
We need more players,
but we have a good team.
So I want to thank everybody
for the teamwork
to put this together,
and for all the work
you're going to do
in the next three years.
So, thanks very much.
-Thank you, Walter.
It's a perfect wrap.
So I think Keith wants to take
a last picture, screenshot.
So, everybody smile
before we say see you in 2025.
Whenever you're ready,
Keith, you let us know.
-I took, like, seven.
We're good.
-Excellent, well,
thank you again,
tremendous whirlwind of science,
you know, compassion,
and pointers for the future.
And we'll see you in 2025.
Thank you.
-Thank you, guys.
-Bye, everybody.
-Probably see you
earlier than that.
-I hope so. Bye-bye.
-Bye.
-Bye.
